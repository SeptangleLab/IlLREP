It is ludicrous for the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee
to make the argument that millions of illegal aliens who
crossed into the country during the Biden Administration
invaded the country because the immigration system is, quote,
``broken.''
The fact is these individuals came because of Biden's open
border policy. No fence, no detention, no removal, and,
frankly, no enforcement. That's what happened.

President Trump's policies in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in
2017 provided much-needed relief to so many American families
and businesses, including in my district and also for my own
business and my own family. Individual income tax rates went
down. The standard deduction was doubled, the Child Tax Credit
went up, and the death tax and corporate tax were slashed.
My district, Georgia-14, is home to over 426,000 taxpayers.
The average taxpayer in Georgia-14 would see a 25 percent tax
hike if Trump's tax cuts expire; a family of 4 making $70,423,
which is the median income in my district, would see a $1,389
tax increase if the cuts expire--this is worth about 8 weeks of
groceries to typical families of 4 in the region; 93,160
Georgia-14 families would see their household's Child Tax
Credit cut in half--this is not manageable for these families;
90 percent of taxpayers in my district would see their
guaranteed deduction slashed in half--they cannot go through
and handle their monthly expenses if this happens; 31,820 small
businesses in Georgia-14 would be hit with a 43.4 percent tax
rate if the small business deduction expires--let me tell you,
that would ensure certain failure for many of these small
businesses; 7,267 of my constituents would be impacted by the
return of the Alternative Minimum Tax; 3,226 family-owned farms
in my district would have their death tax exemption slashed in
half in the half--next year--let me tell you, these people will
lose their family farms; American businesses and individuals
also deal with burdensome regulations simply to trade
securities and invest for their families.
For all these reasons, it is extremely important that we in
Congress support Chairman Smith and support President Trump's
plan to extend these crucial policies. We need to deliver a
historic mandate for the American people, including by
supporting President Trump's campaign promises of no tax on
tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, and tax
credits for caregivers.",2025-01-22_greene.txt,thank chairman president trump policies tax cuts jobs act provided much needed relief many american families businesses including district also business family individual income tax rates went standard deduction doubled child tax credit went death tax corporate tax slashed district georgia home taxpayers average taxpayer georgia would see percent tax hike trump tax cuts expire family making median income district would see tax increase cuts expire worth weeks groceries typical families region georgia families would see household child tax credit cut half manageable families percent taxpayers district would see guaranteed deduction slashed half cannot handle monthly expenses happens small businesses georgia would hit percent tax rate small business deduction expires let tell would ensure certain failure many small businesses constituents would impacted return alternative minimum tax family owned farms district would death tax exemption slashed half half next year let tell people lose family farms american businesses individuals also deal burdensome regulations simply trade securities invest families reasons extremely important congress support chairman smith support president trump plan extend crucial policies need deliver historic mandate american people including supporting president trump campaign promises tax tips tax social security tax overtime tax credits caregivers
2025-01-23,mace,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and honored to be here
today serving on your committee. I was the first one here, by
the way, so--and I want to thank everyone who is here with us
this afternoon. Thank you for your service. Thank you for
sharing your personal stories of pain. It is very difficult for
me to hear that as a mom. It is very tough. I want to thank you
all today.
It is very clear to me the VA's definition of mentally
incompetent has nothing to do with mental health and everything
to do with the simple fact that veterans need help balancing
their checkbooks.
It is a stigma to assume veterans are dangerous or suicidal
simply because they have a mental illness. Every veteran with a
mental illness deserves to be treated like an individual with
individual needs.
We cannot make sweeping policy changes based on harmful
generalizations about disabled veterans, and policies must be
based on real evidence. The VA's Fiduciary Program fails to
consider any evidence of dangerous, and it also fails to
provide veterans with due process. We have got to correct it.
Now, I actually think it is great that there is only one
lawyer on this subcommittee and that we are--no offense. You
spent a lot of time and money in law school, I am sure. I think
it is a good thing that we have--that not everybody here is an
attorney, that we can ask some of the basic, most commonsense
questions about policies for our veterans. We have many
veterans on this committee who can also get into the heart of
it.
Under current VA procedures, veterans' rights are stripped
from them by purely administrative rather than judicial
process. Under these procedures, veterans' rights are unjustly
stripped from them, and Congress must right this wrong. We must
also make sure that the VA is working for our vets and not
against them.",2025-01-23_mace.txt,thank chairman honored today serving committee first one way want thank everyone afternoon thank service thank sharing personal stories pain difficult hear mom tough want thank today clear definition mentally incompetent nothing mental health everything simple fact veterans need help balancing checkbooks stigma assume veterans dangerous suicidal simply mental illness every veteran mental illness deserves treated like individual individual needs cannot make sweeping policy changes based harmful generalizations disabled veterans policies must based real evidence fiduciary program fails consider evidence dangerous also fails provide veterans due process got correct actually think great one lawyer subcommittee offense spent lot time money law school sure think good thing everybody attorney ask basic commonsense questions policies veterans many veterans committee also get heart current procedures veterans rights stripped purely administrative rather judicial process procedures veterans rights unjustly stripped congress must right wrong must also make sure working vets

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed cuts

and Medicare. However, promoting efficiency and cutting
wasteful spending actually protects Social Security and
Medicare by ensuring available and continued funding. And if
they have any more doubts, I would invite them to sign on to my

arm and into the public's domain.

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed cuts

wasteful spending actually protects Social Security and
Medicare by ensuring available and continued funding. And if
they have any more doubts, I would invite them to sign on to my
LASSO Act that actually puts these decisions out of the public
arm and into the public's domain.
When Elon Musk acquired Twitter, now X, in 2022, he fired
about 6,000 employees, or nearly 80 percent of his workforce,
but there was no lapses in X's management, while perhaps only
less community notes and less removal of lawful political

seeing Politico, who is laying folks off, and as they are being
defunded of American tax dollars, they can no longer sustain
themselves. And so, the outrage is just going to continue from
those who are no longer going to be able to support their
businesses from American taxpayers. And we simply want
accountability. We want oversight. This is the Oversight
Committee and, unfortunately, Congress has done a crap job of
oversight and accountability over quite some time, I would say
decades, and that is why we have this new commission that is
created, and Americans are grateful for it. President Trump
campaigned on having this DOGE commission to have oversight and
accountability, and it is our responsibility to codify what
happens.
I am pleased with the expedited efforts that have taken
place to really get this out in the open and expose to the
American people what their money is actually being sent to, and
let us just be honest with the American people. Unelected
bureaucrats have been funneling their hard-earned taxpayer
dollars to ridiculous and even malicious causes. DOGE is doing
the hard work to uncover the truth and make our government work

hurting them. For example, Dr. Resh, in your testimony you

been absolutely unhinged. As we have seen in the media, we are
seeing Politico, who is laying folks off, and as they are being
defunded of American tax dollars, they can no longer sustain
themselves. And so, the outrage is just going to continue from
those who are no longer going to be able to support their
businesses from American taxpayers. And we simply want
accountability. We want oversight. This is the Oversight
Committee and, unfortunately, Congress has done a crap job of
oversight and accountability over quite some time, I would say
decades, and that is why we have this new commission that is
created, and Americans are grateful for it. President Trump
campaigned on having this DOGE commission to have oversight and
accountability, and it is our responsibility to codify what
happens.

American people what their money is actually being sent to, and

hurting them. For example, Dr. Resh, in your testimony you

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed cuts

and Medicare. However, promoting efficiency and cutting
wasteful spending actually protects Social Security and
Medicare by ensuring available and continued funding. And if
they have any more doubts, I would invite them to sign on to my
LASSO Act that actually puts these decisions out of the public
arm and into the public's domain.

advocacy on this and protecting so many animals against this,
as we have heard, savage research that has been taking place,
not only in the United States, but all throughout the world.
And I want to thank our witnesses today for your boldness to
come out because it seems like any time we expose millions and
billions, even, of dollars that are spent toward ridiculous

really exposing to the American taxpayer where their money is

animals, it is much larger than what it sounds because it has
been so watered down to hear that Congress is spending millions
or billions or even trillions of dollars. God forbid if we find

too. But Mr. Goodman, since 1998, how much do you believe that

conversation builds upon the work that I and many of us on
Oversight and throughout Congress have been working on for
years to end animal testing. There are many of us up here, and
we are not working fast enough. We are trying as hard as we
can, so we appreciate the witnesses being here today.
Last Congress, I introduced the Preventing Animal Abuse and
Waste Act to prohibit the NIH from conducting or funding
research that causes significant pain or distress to cats or
dogs. As an animal lover, I have been disturbed to learn about
these barbaric and unnecessary experiments to create
transgender mice, rats, and monkeys. I, like many, most humans,
have a deep adoration and love for all of God's creatures,
including our animals, and one of my earliest memories as a
child was being in Hampton, South Carolina. I was, like, 4
years old, and my grandmother had just made some great biscuits
and breakfast, and she gave me this bright pink album, and it
was just full of pictures of animals from the newspaper from
Hampton, and ever since then, I have just loved them so much,
and I grew up with seven pets. We had three dogs, three cats,
and a parrot named Julio.
And so, it is just important for the work that we are doing
that all of God's creatures, all animals, are treated with
respect and dignity and love, and that they are not murdered
and maimed and killed on these horrific experiments. So, this
Congress, I will continue to fight to end all animal testing,
including by introducing legislation that prohibits use of
Federal funds for these cruel animal sex-change experiments.
Thank you, again, to our panelists. The issue of taxpayer-
funded animal cruelty deserves our time and attention. I am
thankful for your expert testimony today.

years to end animal testing. There are many of us up here, and
we are not working fast enough. We are trying as hard as we
can, so we appreciate the witnesses being here today.
Last Congress, I introduced the Preventing Animal Abuse and
Waste Act to prohibit the NIH from conducting or funding
research that causes significant pain or distress to cats or
dogs. As an animal lover, I have been disturbed to learn about
these barbaric and unnecessary experiments to create
transgender mice, rats, and monkeys. I, like many, most humans,
have a deep adoration and love for all of God's creatures,
including our animals, and one of my earliest memories as a
child was being in Hampton, South Carolina. I was, like, 4
years old, and my grandmother had just made some great biscuits
and breakfast, and she gave me this bright pink album, and it
was just full of pictures of animals from the newspaper from
Hampton, and ever since then, I have just loved them so much,
and I grew up with seven pets. We had three dogs, three cats,
and a parrot named Julio.
And so, it is just important for the work that we are doing
that all of God's creatures, all animals, are treated with
respect and dignity and love, and that they are not murdered
and maimed and killed on these horrific experiments. So, this
Congress, I will continue to fight to end all animal testing,
including by introducing legislation that prohibits use of
Federal funds for these cruel animal sex-change experiments.
Thank you, again, to our panelists. The issue of taxpayer-
funded animal cruelty deserves our time and attention. I am
thankful for your expert testimony today.
And with that, without objection, all Members will have 5
legislative days within which to submit materials and to submit

advocacy on this and protecting so many animals against this,
as we have heard, savage research that has been taking place,
not only in the United States, but all throughout the world.
And I want to thank our witnesses today for your boldness to
come out because it seems like any time we expose millions and
billions, even, of dollars that are spent toward ridiculous
research programs or just organizations themselves, we are
lashed out at. We are called crazy and conspiracist, and I want
to thank you so much for taking a bold step.
I want to thank you for the White Coat Waste Project
because this is not only saving precious Beagles' lives but
really exposing to the American taxpayer where their money is
going, and I think we all want to be good stewards of our tax
money. We are responsible for those tax dollars here in
Congress, and it is our responsibility to be stewards and
overseers of that. So, I am grateful for DOGE to come in
alongside of us to help expose some of this and kind of get
those wheels turning.
But just for the folks back home real quick, before I get
into my questions, I want to just highlight, a million seconds
is 11-and-a-half days. A billion seconds is 31 years and 7
months. It is, like, this is a huge difference. When we are
talking about billions of dollars going toward the cruelty of
animals, it is much larger than what it sounds because it has
been so watered down to hear that Congress is spending millions
or billions or even trillions of dollars. God forbid if we find
out what comes after a trillion. We will start spending that,
too. But Mr. Goodman, since 1998, how much do you believe that
the Federal Government has spent on animal cruelty testing?",2025-02-06_greene.txt,thank madam chair appreciate advocacy protecting many animals heard savage research taking place united states throughout world want thank witnesses today boldness come seems like time expose millions billions even dollars spent toward ridiculous research programs organizations lashed called crazy conspiracist want thank much taking bold step want thank white coat waste project saving precious beagles lives really exposing american taxpayer money going think want good stewards tax money responsible tax dollars congress responsibility stewards overseers grateful doge come alongside help expose kind get wheels turning folks back home real quick get questions want highlight million seconds half days billion seconds years months like huge difference talking billions dollars going toward cruelty animals much larger sounds watered hear congress spending millions billions even trillions dollars god forbid find comes trillion start spending goodman since much believe federal government spent animal cruelty testing

2025-02-06,boebert,"Thank you, Madam Chair, and I appreciate your
advocacy on this and protecting so many animals against this,
as we have heard, savage research that has been taking place,
not only in the United States, but all throughout the world.
And I want to thank our witnesses today for your boldness to
come out because it seems like any time we expose millions and
billions, even, of dollars that are spent toward ridiculous
research programs or just organizations themselves, we are
lashed out at. We are called crazy and conspiracist, and I want
to thank you so much for taking a bold step.
I want to thank you for the White Coat Waste Project
because this is not only saving precious Beagles' lives but
really exposing to the American taxpayer where their money is
going, and I think we all want to be good stewards of our tax
money. We are responsible for those tax dollars here in
Congress, and it is our responsibility to be stewards and
overseers of that. So, I am grateful for DOGE to come in
alongside of us to help expose some of this and kind of get
those wheels turning.
But just for the folks back home real quick, before I get
into my questions, I want to just highlight, a million seconds
is 11-and-a-half days. A billion seconds is 31 years and 7
months. It is, like, this is a huge difference. When we are
talking about billions of dollars going toward the cruelty of
animals, it is much larger than what it sounds because it has
been so watered down to hear that Congress is spending millions
or billions or even trillions of dollars. God forbid if we find
out what comes after a trillion. We will start spending that,
too. But Mr. Goodman, since 1998, how much do you believe that
the Federal Government has spent on animal cruelty testing?",2025-02-06_mace.txt,thank madam chair appreciate advocacy protecting many animals heard savage research taking place united states throughout world want thank witnesses today boldness come seems like time expose millions billions even dollars spent toward ridiculous research programs organizations lashed called crazy conspiracist want thank much taking bold step want thank white coat waste project saving precious beagles lives really exposing american taxpayer money going think want good stewards tax money responsible tax dollars congress responsibility stewards overseers grateful doge come alongside help expose kind get wheels turning folks back home real quick get questions want highlight million seconds half days billion seconds years months like huge difference talking billions dollars going toward cruelty animals much larger sounds watered hear congress spending millions billions even trillions dollars god forbid find comes trillion start spending goodman since much believe federal government spent animal cruelty testing

look forward to working with you. While we were just talking
offline here, I was saying I want to get on her bill about
cosmetics and animal testing, so all good things today. Today's
conversation builds upon the work that I and many of us on
Oversight and throughout Congress have been working on for
years to end animal testing. There are many of us up here, and
we are not working fast enough. We are trying as hard as we
can, so we appreciate the witnesses being here today.
Last Congress, I introduced the Preventing Animal Abuse and
Waste Act to prohibit the NIH from conducting or funding
research that causes significant pain or distress to cats or
dogs. As an animal lover, I have been disturbed to learn about
these barbaric and unnecessary experiments to create
transgender mice, rats, and monkeys. I, like many, most humans,
have a deep adoration and love for all of God's creatures,
including our animals, and one of my earliest memories as a
child was being in Hampton, South Carolina. I was, like, 4
years old, and my grandmother had just made some great biscuits
and breakfast, and she gave me this bright pink album, and it
was just full of pictures of animals from the newspaper from
Hampton, and ever since then, I have just loved them so much,
and I grew up with seven pets. We had three dogs, three cats,
and a parrot named Julio.
And so, it is just important for the work that we are doing
that all of God's creatures, all animals, are treated with
respect and dignity and love, and that they are not murdered
and maimed and killed on these horrific experiments. So, this
Congress, I will continue to fight to end all animal testing,
including by introducing legislation that prohibits use of
Federal funds for these cruel animal sex-change experiments.
Thank you, again, to our panelists. The issue of taxpayer-
funded animal cruelty deserves our time and attention. I am
thankful for your expert testimony today.
And with that, without objection, all Members will have 5
legislative days within which to submit materials and to submit
additional written questions for the witnesses, which will then
be forwarded to the witnesses for their response.",2025-02-06_mace.txt,want thank ranking member look forward working talking offline saying want get bill cosmetics animal testing good things today today conversation builds upon work many oversight throughout congress working years end animal testing many working fast enough trying hard appreciate witnesses today last congress introduced preventing animal abuse waste act prohibit nih conducting funding research causes significant pain distress cats dogs animal lover disturbed learn barbaric unnecessary experiments create transgender mice rats monkeys like many humans deep adoration love god creatures including animals one earliest memories child hampton south carolina like years old grandmother made great biscuits breakfast gave bright pink album full pictures animals newspaper hampton ever since loved much grew seven pets three dogs three cats parrot named julio important work god creatures animals treated respect dignity love murdered maimed killed horrific experiments congress continue fight end animal testing including introducing legislation prohibits use federal funds cruel animal sex change experiments thank panelists issue taxpayer funded animal cruelty deserves time attention thankful expert testimony today without objection members legislative days within submit materials submit additional written questions witnesses forwarded witnesses response

some steps to address this issue. Much more needs to be done to
control billions of dollars in overpayments and prevent fraud.
For example, CMS should improve the timeliness of audits to
identify and recover improper payments. You also make clear
that while congressional action may be necessary to eliminate
issues and that interagency coordination is needed, no progress
has been made on improving Medicaid program integrity since it
was added in 2023.
In 2023, GAO designated the unemployment insurance system
as high-risk because ``unemployment insurance is administrative
and program integrity challenges pose significant risk to
service delivery and expose the system to significant financial
losses.'' Similarly, GAO has ``designated Medicare as a high-
risk program due to its size, complexity, effect on the Federal
budget, and susceptibility to improper payments.'' Further, the

I was excited to see President Trump put out a post, a
truth, on Truth Social, that said, ``The month of February, my
first full month in office, had the lowest number of illegal
immigrants trying to enter our country in history by far. There
were only 8,326 apprehensions of illegals by Border Patrol at
the U.S. Mexico border, all of whom were quickly ejected from
our Nation or, when necessary, prosecuted for crimes against
the United States of America. This means that very few people
came. The invasion of our country is over. In comparison, under
Joe Biden, there were 300,000 illegals crossing in 1 month, and
virtually all of them were released into our country. Thanks to
the Trump Administration policies, the border is closed to all
illegal aliens.'' ``Immigrants'' is what he what he put.
``Anyone who tries to illegally enter the U.S.A. will face
significant criminal penalties and immediate deportation.'' I

I hope we can start off on a level-field of agreement here. So,
in your testimony, you said that locals were asking Denver what
will you do when they saw 10 to 11 buses coming in a day and
42,000 illegal aliens entering their city. Denver, what will
you do? And in a Fox31 interview in January, you blamed state
law for not allowing the city of Denver to coordinate with ICE,
resulting in Denver being a sanctuary city, saying, ``The whole
state is bound by our state law in this, which is pretty
consistent in some of these practices. Like, everywhere in the
state, we do not honor ICE detainers.'' I have demanded
Governor Jared Polis and the Colorado State Legislature to
repeal them. Douglas County has led on a lawsuit to get those
laws repealed. So, Mr. Mayor, would you join me today in
calling and demanding that these sanctuary policies, these
Colorado state laws be repealed?",2025-03-05_boebert.txt,thank chairman mayor mike johnston hope start level field agreement testimony said locals asking denver saw buses coming day illegal aliens entering city denver fox interview january blamed state law allowing city denver coordinate ice resulting denver sanctuary city saying whole state bound state law pretty consistent practices like everywhere state honor ice detainers demanded governor jared polis colorado state legislature repeal douglas county led lawsuit get laws repealed mayor would join today calling demanding sanctuary policies colorado state laws repealed

2025-03-05,gosar,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mayor Wu, I will be
showing up at your house tomorrow with my bags at 5. Leave your
doors unlocked, please. What are you making for dinner because
I expect a new warm meal and a balanced diet. Now, I am going
to need a car, and please leave me some cash because I am going
to need to go to my doctor's appointment on Friday. That would
be to Mayor Johnson. Now, I do not want to sleep on the couch,
so put me up at a luxury hotel. Another to Mayor Johnson.
Obviously, you would not like this because you do not know me,
right? You know nothing about me. You might not like that.
Sanctuary cities offer this kind of hope, this false hope to
illegal aliens by saying that very thing. Stay with me. We do
not tell anybody that you break our laws. Now, thank you. You
have made the United States complicit and one of the largest
purveyors of human trafficking in the world. Thank you. You are
disgracing the legal immigration system and the immigrants that
came here the right way through Ellis Island at the time, now
going through a process.
And I want to talk about that process because I have always
been told, and it has never been really challenged, is that
good process builds good policy, builds good politics. I think
that works really, really good because you can always fall back
to the process. If the process is not good, you always get a
bad process. Now, you heard the word ``establishing trust,''
OK? How can you establish trust at the very beginning when you
have a false narrative here? You are defending folks who have
broken the law. The definition I have always looked at is trust
is a series of promises kept. What kind of trust you are
supporting here? What is the trust in an illegal alien? It is a
false hope. It is a false trust. Welcome, we are bringing you
in. It is a disorganized process.
Now, let me ask you a question, Mr. Adams. Did you support

its supremacy clause because we, in Arizona, the government was
not doing anything, so we thought we will do this. We cannot
allow them to break laws, and the Supreme Court ruled, struck
it down. Now, it seems contraindicating here that you would

over here--you have agreed today that New York City is a
sanctuary city. Is that right?",2025-03-05_boebert.txt,thank chairman mayor adams sorry agreed today new york city sanctuary city right
2025-03-05,biggs,"Right, but that is what you have proclaimed.
Mayor Johnston, you have previously also declared that you are
a sanctuary city. Mayor Johnson, you said that Chicago must
lead with and live by the promise to be a sanctuary city. Mayor
Wu, you said Boston police and other departments cannot
cooperate with ICE when it comes to detaining on civil
warrants. Of course, I do not know what Mayor Johnston would
define it, but I do know that the Honorable Mayor Johnston from
Chicago, they call theirs a Welcoming City ordinance, and we
have got Ms. Wu, Mayor Wu, who has referred to hers as a safe
city. That is really interesting to me.
So, when you are a sanctuary city, you put limits on how
much you are willing to cooperate with Federal agencies'
efforts to remove illegal aliens, and your policies then
contravene Federal law. You just do. Under Title 8 of the U.S.
Code, it says, ``A Federal, state, or local government entity
or official may not prohibit or in any way restrict any
government entity or official from sending to or receiving from
the Immigration Naturalization Service any information
regarding citizenship or immigration status of any
individual.''
So, when I look at your guys' ordinances, and I got them
all up here, and they are really interesting stuff, in Denver,
I think you testified previously that you rely on the statutory
section--am I right--of the state statute, so let us just
review this. There is a distinction, and some of you have made
that.

I hope we can start off on a level-field of agreement here. So,
in your testimony, you said that locals were asking Denver what
will you do when they saw 10 to 11 buses coming in a day and
42,000 illegal aliens entering their city. Denver, what will
you do? And in a Fox31 interview in January, you blamed state
law for not allowing the city of Denver to coordinate with ICE,
resulting in Denver being a sanctuary city, saying, ``The whole
state is bound by our state law in this, which is pretty
consistent in some of these practices. Like, everywhere in the
state, we do not honor ICE detainers.'' I have demanded
Governor Jared Polis and the Colorado State Legislature to
repeal them. Douglas County has led on a lawsuit to get those
laws repealed. So, Mr. Mayor, would you join me today in

right? You know nothing about me. You might not like that.
Sanctuary cities offer this kind of hope, this false hope to
illegal aliens by saying that very thing. Stay with me. We do
not tell anybody that you break our laws. Now, thank you. You
have made the United States complicit and one of the largest
purveyors of human trafficking in the world. Thank you. You are
disgracing the legal immigration system and the immigrants that
came here the right way through Ellis Island at the time, now
going through a process.
And I want to talk about that process because I have always
been told, and it has never been really challenged, is that
good process builds good policy, builds good politics. I think
that works really, really good because you can always fall back
to the process. If the process is not good, you always get a
bad process. Now, you heard the word ``establishing trust,''
OK? How can you establish trust at the very beginning when you
have a false narrative here? You are defending folks who have
broken the law. The definition I have always looked at is trust
is a series of promises kept. What kind of trust you are
supporting here? What is the trust in an illegal alien? It is a
false hope. It is a false trust. Welcome, we are bringing you

Mayor Johnston, you have previously also declared that you are

Wu, you said Boston police and other departments cannot
cooperate with ICE when it comes to detaining on civil
warrants. Of course, I do not know what Mayor Johnston would
define it, but I do know that the Honorable Mayor Johnston from
Chicago, they call theirs a Welcoming City ordinance, and we
have got Ms. Wu, Mayor Wu, who has referred to hers as a safe
city. That is really interesting to me.
So, when you are a sanctuary city, you put limits on how
much you are willing to cooperate with Federal agencies'
efforts to remove illegal aliens, and your policies then
contravene Federal law. You just do. Under Title 8 of the U.S.
Code, it says, ``A Federal, state, or local government entity
or official may not prohibit or in any way restrict any
government entity or official from sending to or receiving from
the Immigration Naturalization Service any information
regarding citizenship or immigration status of any
individual.''
So, when I look at your guys' ordinances, and I got them
all up here, and they are really interesting stuff, in Denver,

42,000 illegal aliens entering their city. Denver, what will
you do? And in a Fox31 interview in January, you blamed state
law for not allowing the city of Denver to coordinate with ICE,
resulting in Denver being a sanctuary city, saying, ``The whole
state is bound by our state law in this, which is pretty
consistent in some of these practices. Like, everywhere in the
state, we do not honor ICE detainers.'' I have demanded
Governor Jared Polis and the Colorado State Legislature to

right? You know nothing about me. You might not like that.
Sanctuary cities offer this kind of hope, this false hope to
illegal aliens by saying that very thing. Stay with me. We do
not tell anybody that you break our laws. Now, thank you. You
have made the United States complicit and one of the largest
purveyors of human trafficking in the world. Thank you. You are
disgracing the legal immigration system and the immigrants that
came here the right way through Ellis Island at the time, now
going through a process.
And I want to talk about that process because I have always
been told, and it has never been really challenged, is that
good process builds good policy, builds good politics. I think
that works really, really good because you can always fall back
to the process. If the process is not good, you always get a
bad process. Now, you heard the word ``establishing trust,''
OK? How can you establish trust at the very beginning when you
have a false narrative here? You are defending folks who have
broken the law. The definition I have always looked at is trust
is a series of promises kept. What kind of trust you are
supporting here? What is the trust in an illegal alien? It is a
false hope. It is a false trust. Welcome, we are bringing you
in. It is a disorganized process.
Now, let me ask you a question, Mr. Adams. Did you support

Mayor Johnston, you have previously also declared that you are
a sanctuary city. Mayor Johnson, you said that Chicago must
lead with and live by the promise to be a sanctuary city. Mayor
Wu, you said Boston police and other departments cannot
cooperate with ICE when it comes to detaining on civil
warrants. Of course, I do not know what Mayor Johnston would
define it, but I do know that the Honorable Mayor Johnston from
Chicago, they call theirs a Welcoming City ordinance, and we
have got Ms. Wu, Mayor Wu, who has referred to hers as a safe
city. That is really interesting to me.
So, when you are a sanctuary city, you put limits on how
much you are willing to cooperate with Federal agencies'
efforts to remove illegal aliens, and your policies then
contravene Federal law. You just do. Under Title 8 of the U.S.
Code, it says, ``A Federal, state, or local government entity
or official may not prohibit or in any way restrict any
government entity or official from sending to or receiving from
the Immigration Naturalization Service any information
regarding citizenship or immigration status of any
individual.''
So, when I look at your guys' ordinances, and I got them
all up here, and they are really interesting stuff, in Denver,
I think you testified previously that you rely on the statutory
section--am I right--of the state statute, so let us just
review this. There is a distinction, and some of you have made

42,000 illegal aliens entering their city. Denver, what will
you do? And in a Fox31 interview in January, you blamed state
law for not allowing the city of Denver to coordinate with ICE,
resulting in Denver being a sanctuary city, saying, ``The whole
state is bound by our state law in this, which is pretty
consistent in some of these practices. Like, everywhere in the
state, we do not honor ICE detainers.'' I have demanded
Governor Jared Polis and the Colorado State Legislature to
repeal them. Douglas County has led on a lawsuit to get those

Mayor Johnston, you have previously also declared that you are
a sanctuary city. Mayor Johnson, you said that Chicago must
lead with and live by the promise to be a sanctuary city. Mayor
Wu, you said Boston police and other departments cannot
cooperate with ICE when it comes to detaining on civil
warrants. Of course, I do not know what Mayor Johnston would
define it, but I do know that the Honorable Mayor Johnston from
Chicago, they call theirs a Welcoming City ordinance, and we
have got Ms. Wu, Mayor Wu, who has referred to hers as a safe
city. That is really interesting to me.
So, when you are a sanctuary city, you put limits on how
much you are willing to cooperate with Federal agencies'
efforts to remove illegal aliens, and your policies then
contravene Federal law. You just do. Under Title 8 of the U.S.
Code, it says, ``A Federal, state, or local government entity
or official may not prohibit or in any way restrict any
government entity or official from sending to or receiving from
the Immigration Naturalization Service any information
regarding citizenship or immigration status of any
individual.''
So, when I look at your guys' ordinances, and I got them
all up here, and they are really interesting stuff, in Denver,
I think you testified previously that you rely on the statutory
section--am I right--of the state statute, so let us just
review this. There is a distinction, and some of you have made

selected tournament competition locations based on state

perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,

our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.

standing up for girls and women when she is the one who
supports sex change surgeries for little kids and forcing women
to undress in front of creepy, perverted men. I will let the
American people decide who the weirdos are because I think we
know.

perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,

issue of men competing in women's sports should not even have

Today, we conducted oversight of our Nation's national

our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.

standing up for girls and women when she is the one who
supports sex change surgeries for little kids and forcing women
to undress in front of creepy, perverted men. I will let the
American people decide who the weirdos are because I think we
know.

perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,
especially when it is being done with our own tax dollars. The
issue of men competing in women's sports should not even have
to be a discussion. It is unfair, unsafe, and straight-up
abusive.

Today, we conducted oversight of our Nation's national
governing body for the sport of fencing, and with so many of
our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.

standing up for girls and women when she is the one who
supports sex change surgeries for little kids and forcing women
to undress in front of creepy, perverted men. I will let the
American people decide who the weirdos are because I think we
know.
The American people are tired of cultural Marxism and
perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,
especially when it is being done with our own tax dollars. The
issue of men competing in women's sports should not even have
to be a discussion. It is unfair, unsafe, and straight-up
abusive.

Today, we conducted oversight of our Nation's national

our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.

standing up for girls and women when she is the one who
supports sex change surgeries for little kids and forcing women
to undress in front of creepy, perverted men. I will let the
American people decide who the weirdos are because I think we
know.

perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,
especially when it is being done with our own tax dollars. The
issue of men competing in women's sports should not even have

abusive.

Today, we conducted oversight of our Nation's national

our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.

perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,

to be a discussion. It is unfair, unsafe, and straight-up

For decades, elements in our government have engaged in an
extensive cover-up to subvert the will of Congress and to keep
the American public in the dark relating to the assassination
of John F. Kennedy. No matter how ugly it is or how
inconvenient it is to elites, organized crime, or deep state
bureaucrats, the American people deserve the truth, and they
can handle the truth.
While the American public still may be in the dark, poll
after poll made clear the cover-up has failed. Approximately
two-thirds of Americans still do not buy the official narrative
from our government that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Cover-
ups and a failure to be transparent has rightfully bred
distrust, so much distrust nearly 40 percent of Americans
believe the U.S. Government was involved in the assassination
of JFK. Let that sink in--nearly 40 percent.

two-thirds of Americans still do not buy the official narrative

2025-06-05,gosar,"Thanks, Chairwoman. Ms. Miller, you described
the COVID process as a catastrophic event with a high risk of
fraud. I agree. I am the only non-U.S. resident in the United
States to have ever killed a national emergency. I killed
COVID, but there is not a single receipt, though, and since
Bill Clinton through Joe Biden, we have spent over $13
trillion--let me say that again--$13 trillion without a
receipt. Could we use AI to examine the funds spent under
COVID?",2025-06-05_biggs.txt,thanks chairwoman miller described covid process catastrophic event high risk fraud agree non resident united states ever killed national emergency killed covid single receipt though since bill clinton joe biden spent trillion let say trillion without receipt could use examine funds spent covid

One of my concerns, coming from a technology background,
like, I learned COBOL back in 1999, and a lot of our systems
today, they are on legacy systems. We waste a lot of money on
that, and then with the advent of AI and how fast technology is
moving, you know, the Federal Government has real challenges
with moving forward in a quick way and competing against our
adversaries. So, this is my first question to all the panelists
this afternoon, is if you could just do one thing that could
advance the Federal Government in any way, any agency, any
capability, if you could just do one thing today to help us
utilize AI and technology to move the ball forward, what is
that? What is the one thing you would do? Does not have to be
something big. It could be a small part that makes a big
difference. But what is that one thing you would do right now,
if we could do it tomorrow, snap our fingers?

2025-06-05,greene,"[Presiding.] The gentlelady yields. I now
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I
will start with you. Do you support federalism? Yes or no?",2025-06-05_biggs.txt,presiding gentlelady yields recognize minutes passed one big beautiful bill house representatives gone senate making changes bill changes made one big beautiful bill comes back house vote get second bite apple bill going committees discussed house representatives one either side aisle know republican democrat brought particular clause one single page page bill want bring think incredibly important support many different faculties however think time generation much responsible congress leaders tech industry leaders states around world incredible responsibility future development regulation laws important responsibility literally affects children grandchildren future take responsibility incredibly sincere much past week come full transparency said voted one big beautiful bill know clause thought voting taxes energy border security clause right says moratorium general except provided paragraph state political subdivision thereof may enforce year period beginning date enactment act law regulation state political subdivision thereof limiting restricting otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models artificial intelligence systems automated decision systems entered interstate commerce comprehensive year moratorium actually pause years federalism right passed law tell states cannot regulate make laws regarding means federal government governing body regulate make laws united states america would like ask support federalism yes start support federalism yes

are extremely important, and AI is, whether we like it or not,
and it is helpful in many ways, and it is not helpful, will
replace jobs. I have a manufacturing district, and the
manufacturing companies are important, but so are the people's
jobs. And if our state cannot regulate or make laws to protect
people's jobs, people are going to go hungry. They are not
going to have paychecks. They are not going to put roofs over
their families' heads. And I think this is such a serious
issue, that we need to look at this through--I will state it
very clearly, I am pro humanity. I am not pro transhumanity.
And when it comes to AI and regulation, when we get to vote on
this bill again, I will be voting no because of this clause,
and we will be working on this further. Thank you so much for

2025-06-05,luna,"Thank you, Madam Chair. You know, I want to
thank you all for being here today. One of the biggest concerns
I have with this whole discussion on AI is a failure to admit,
first and foremost, that it does appear that in the next 10
years, that the way that we have grown up and know life with AI
will be forever changing. With that being said, there are a few
differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think
that that is a very serious topic that needs to be discussed
right now.
But specifically, to transhumanism and coupling of AI with
humanity, what regulatory frameworks can be established to
ensure AI-driven transhumanist technologies, like brain-
computer interfaces prioritize human safety and consent? I am
opening this up to everyone on the panel. I have a few
questions, so I would like to get through this, so just please
limit your responses. Mr. B, if you want to go first, or down

2025-06-05,luna,"Is there the possibility of regulation, though,
that exists that would enable transhumanist enhancements that
exacerbate social inequalities or basically financial
inequalities, creating an elite class of enhanced individuals?
I bring that up because we are talking about low-level jobs
potentially being removed from the workforce, people that have
and can afford the ability of, for example, implementing or
implanting chips, given access to unknown amounts of, you know,
knowledge, and essentially creating the first superhuman, and
this is a real concern. I know it might come across as funny to
other people, but I am genuinely concerned about this.
You know, from a bipartisan perspective here, we are
talking about humanity versus machine. Hopefully, in a flowery
world, we would have it set up to where it could, you know,
improve society for the best, but I am also in politics, and I
have a very, unfortunately, sometimes negative perspective on
the world because I have seen the worst of humanity in this
job.",2025-06-05_biggs.txt,possibility regulation though exists would enable transhumanist enhancements exacerbate social inequalities basically financial inequalities creating elite class enhanced individuals bring talking low level jobs potentially removed workforce people afford ability example implementing implanting chips given access unknown amounts know knowledge essentially creating first superhuman real concern know might come across funny people genuinely concerned know bipartisan perspective talking humanity versus machine hopefully flowery world would set could know improve society best also politics unfortunately sometimes negative perspective world seen worst humanity job

One of my concerns, coming from a technology background,

today, they are on legacy systems. We waste a lot of money on
that, and then with the advent of AI and how fast technology is
moving, you know, the Federal Government has real challenges
with moving forward in a quick way and competing against our

this afternoon, is if you could just do one thing that could
advance the Federal Government in any way, any agency, any
capability, if you could just do one thing today to help us
utilize AI and technology to move the ball forward, what is
that? What is the one thing you would do? Does not have to be

recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I
will start with you. Do you support federalism?

thank you all for being here today. One of the biggest concerns
I have with this whole discussion on AI is a failure to admit,
first and foremost, that it does appear that in the next 10
years, that the way that we have grown up and know life with AI
will be forever changing. With that being said, there are a few
differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think
that that is a very serious topic that needs to be discussed
right now.
But specifically, to transhumanism and coupling of AI with
humanity, what regulatory frameworks can be established to
ensure AI-driven transhumanist technologies, like brain-
computer interfaces prioritize human safety and consent? I am
opening this up to everyone on the panel. I have a few

that exists that would enable transhumanist enhancements that
exacerbate social inequalities or basically financial
inequalities, creating an elite class of enhanced individuals?
I bring that up because we are talking about low-level jobs
potentially being removed from the workforce, people that have
and can afford the ability of, for example, implementing or
implanting chips, given access to unknown amounts of, you know,
knowledge, and essentially creating the first superhuman, and
this is a real concern. I know it might come across as funny to
other people, but I am genuinely concerned about this.
You know, from a bipartisan perspective here, we are
talking about humanity versus machine. Hopefully, in a flowery
world, we would have it set up to where it could, you know,
improve society for the best, but I am also in politics, and I

thank you all for being here today. One of the biggest concerns
I have with this whole discussion on AI is a failure to admit,
first and foremost, that it does appear that in the next 10
years, that the way that we have grown up and know life with AI
will be forever changing. With that being said, there are a few
differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think
that that is a very serious topic that needs to be discussed
right now.
But specifically, to transhumanism and coupling of AI with
humanity, what regulatory frameworks can be established to
ensure AI-driven transhumanist technologies, like brain-
computer interfaces prioritize human safety and consent? I am
opening this up to everyone on the panel. I have a few
questions, so I would like to get through this, so just please

2025-06-05,luna,"Is there the possibility of regulation, though,
that exists that would enable transhumanist enhancements that
exacerbate social inequalities or basically financial
inequalities, creating an elite class of enhanced individuals?
I bring that up because we are talking about low-level jobs
potentially being removed from the workforce, people that have
and can afford the ability of, for example, implementing or
implanting chips, given access to unknown amounts of, you know,
knowledge, and essentially creating the first superhuman, and
this is a real concern. I know it might come across as funny to
other people, but I am genuinely concerned about this.
You know, from a bipartisan perspective here, we are
talking about humanity versus machine. Hopefully, in a flowery
world, we would have it set up to where it could, you know,
improve society for the best, but I am also in politics, and I

recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I

differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think

implanting chips, given access to unknown amounts of, you know,

recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I

thank you all for being here today. One of the biggest concerns
I have with this whole discussion on AI is a failure to admit,
first and foremost, that it does appear that in the next 10
years, that the way that we have grown up and know life with AI
will be forever changing. With that being said, there are a few
differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think
that that is a very serious topic that needs to be discussed
right now.

humanity, what regulatory frameworks can be established to

today, they are on legacy systems. We waste a lot of money on

moving, you know, the Federal Government has real challenges
with moving forward in a quick way and competing against our
adversaries. So, this is my first question to all the panelists

advance the Federal Government in any way, any agency, any
capability, if you could just do one thing today to help us
utilize AI and technology to move the ball forward, what is
that? What is the one thing you would do? Does not have to be
something big. It could be a small part that makes a big

recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I
will start with you. Do you support federalism?

jobs. And if our state cannot regulate or make laws to protect
people's jobs, people are going to go hungry. They are not
going to have paychecks. They are not going to put roofs over

issue, that we need to look at this through--I will state it

thank you all for being here today. One of the biggest concerns
I have with this whole discussion on AI is a failure to admit,
first and foremost, that it does appear that in the next 10
years, that the way that we have grown up and know life with AI
will be forever changing. With that being said, there are a few
differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think
that that is a very serious topic that needs to be discussed
right now.
But specifically, to transhumanism and coupling of AI with
humanity, what regulatory frameworks can be established to
ensure AI-driven transhumanist technologies, like brain-
computer interfaces prioritize human safety and consent? I am

potentially being removed from the workforce, people that have

talking about humanity versus machine. Hopefully, in a flowery

So, the Trump Administration said we are not going to do
that anymore. Federal claims court says, ``That is right. You
do not have to do that.'' Then the district court judge in D.C.
came in and said, ``Well, wait a second. We are going to
reinstate that.'' The result is you sideline some of the best
contractors, which we were already talking about in the
procurement system, you sideline many contractors. Many
entrepreneurs may be interested, but they do not want to get
into it because it is so bad.
In my state, because of the PLAs, businesses are forced to
abandon bids. They are forced to get into unionization. And
this is a state where 97 percent of the workers are non-
unionized. I mean, this is just absurd. So, we end up rigging

2025-06-11,biggs,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses
for coming.
So, everybody but Mr. Schwartz--but I knew you were
thinking this too--all of you mentioned Congress' failure to do
a budget but to resort to CRs repeatedly, that that is a major
problem. It is a major problem, and shame on Congress. In my
entire time here, I have only voted for one CR, and I kind of
have buyer's remorse even over that one.
The other thing is, DoD has consistently had crappy audits.
They have never passed an audit, to be frank. And it is because
you have a sclerotic, bureaucratic system, and they told us,
``We are too big to be audited. We do not know where it is all
going.'' That is a huge, huge problem.
So, we have been focusing on procurement today, but I will
just tell you that the previous administration also implemented
something called Project Labor Agreements on Federal contracts.
And those agreements kill competition, they inflate prices,
they block non-union contractors from fair opportunities.
