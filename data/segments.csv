It is ludicrous for the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee
to make the argument that millions of illegal aliens who
crossed into the country during the Biden Administration
invaded the country because the immigration system is, quote,
``broken.''
The fact is these individuals came because of Biden's open
border policy. No fence, no detention, no removal, and,
frankly, no enforcement. That's what happened.

President Trump's policies in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in
2017 provided much-needed relief to so many American families
and businesses, including in my district and also for my own
business and my own family. Individual income tax rates went
down. The standard deduction was doubled, the Child Tax Credit
went up, and the death tax and corporate tax were slashed.
My district, Georgia-14, is home to over 426,000 taxpayers.
The average taxpayer in Georgia-14 would see a 25 percent tax
hike if Trump's tax cuts expire; a family of 4 making $70,423,
which is the median income in my district, would see a $1,389
tax increase if the cuts expire--this is worth about 8 weeks of
groceries to typical families of 4 in the region; 93,160
Georgia-14 families would see their household's Child Tax
Credit cut in half--this is not manageable for these families;
90 percent of taxpayers in my district would see their
guaranteed deduction slashed in half--they cannot go through
and handle their monthly expenses if this happens; 31,820 small
businesses in Georgia-14 would be hit with a 43.4 percent tax
rate if the small business deduction expires--let me tell you,
that would ensure certain failure for many of these small
businesses; 7,267 of my constituents would be impacted by the
return of the Alternative Minimum Tax; 3,226 family-owned farms
in my district would have their death tax exemption slashed in
half in the half--next year--let me tell you, these people will
lose their family farms; American businesses and individuals
also deal with burdensome regulations simply to trade
securities and invest for their families.
For all these reasons, it is extremely important that we in
Congress support Chairman Smith and support President Trump's
plan to extend these crucial policies. We need to deliver a
historic mandate for the American people, including by
supporting President Trump's campaign promises of no tax on
tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, and tax
credits for caregivers.",2025-01-22_greene.txt
2025-01-23,mace,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and honored to be here
today serving on your committee. I was the first one here, by
the way, so--and I want to thank everyone who is here with us
this afternoon. Thank you for your service. Thank you for
sharing your personal stories of pain. It is very difficult for
me to hear that as a mom. It is very tough. I want to thank you
all today.
It is very clear to me the VA's definition of mentally
incompetent has nothing to do with mental health and everything
to do with the simple fact that veterans need help balancing
their checkbooks.
It is a stigma to assume veterans are dangerous or suicidal
simply because they have a mental illness. Every veteran with a
mental illness deserves to be treated like an individual with
individual needs.
We cannot make sweeping policy changes based on harmful
generalizations about disabled veterans, and policies must be
based on real evidence. The VA's Fiduciary Program fails to
consider any evidence of dangerous, and it also fails to
provide veterans with due process. We have got to correct it.
Now, I actually think it is great that there is only one
lawyer on this subcommittee and that we are--no offense. You
spent a lot of time and money in law school, I am sure. I think
it is a good thing that we have--that not everybody here is an
attorney, that we can ask some of the basic, most commonsense
questions about policies for our veterans. We have many
veterans on this committee who can also get into the heart of
it.
Under current VA procedures, veterans' rights are stripped
from them by purely administrative rather than judicial
process. Under these procedures, veterans' rights are unjustly
stripped from them, and Congress must right this wrong. We must
also make sure that the VA is working for our vets and not
against them.",2025-01-23_mace.txt

tame the labyrinth of the Federal bureaucracy. That is why I

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed cuts

wasteful spending actually protects Social Security and
Medicare by ensuring available and continued funding. And if
they have any more doubts, I would invite them to sign on to my

arm and into the public's domain.

been absolutely unhinged. As we have seen in the media, we are
seeing Politico, who is laying folks off, and as they are being
defunded of American tax dollars, they can no longer sustain
themselves. And so, the outrage is just going to continue from
those who are no longer going to be able to support their
businesses from American taxpayers. And we simply want
accountability. We want oversight. This is the Oversight
Committee and, unfortunately, Congress has done a crap job of
oversight and accountability over quite some time, I would say
decades, and that is why we have this new commission that is
created, and Americans are grateful for it. President Trump
campaigned on having this DOGE commission to have oversight and
accountability, and it is our responsibility to codify what
happens.
I am pleased with the expedited efforts that have taken
place to really get this out in the open and expose to the
American people what their money is actually being sent to, and
let us just be honest with the American people. Unelected
bureaucrats have been funneling their hard-earned taxpayer
dollars to ridiculous and even malicious causes. DOGE is doing
the hard work to uncover the truth and make our government work
for the people rather than funding policies that are actively
hurting them. For example, Dr. Resh, in your testimony you
state that the recommendations from the Department of

2025-02-05,boebert,"I think there has been a lot of
inefficiencies, and I am excited to see where this goes and the
exposure of that, and, Dr. Resh, the last Administration
weaponized NGOs to aid and abet illegal aliens across and
within the interior of the United States. We saw millions of
taxpayer dollars being funneled to NGOs that were spent on
plane and bus tickets, hotel rooms, and even to coach illegal
aliens on how to illegally stay in the country. Heck, we have a
Congresswoman who is currently coaching illegal aliens on how
to stay in the country, what terms to use, even if they are
untruthful. Now, Dr. Resh, how does transporting millions of
unvetted illegal aliens into our country make America safer,
and how does stopping the funding of those NGOs harm America?",2025-02-05_biggs.txt
2025-02-05,boebert,"Oh, it is not irrelevant. Let us go through
the list of relevancy, shall we? When we have open borders
allowing millions of illegal aliens coming into our country
unvetted, then the relevancy is in terms of Laken Riley,
Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Ruby Garcia, Lizbeth Medina,
and I could go on and on and on and on with the American
citizens who were killed at the hands of illegal aliens. So, I
think it is pretty relevant to say we need to look into these
NGOs and what they are doing with these unvetted illegal aliens
coming into our country and remaining into our country. Would
you agree? Does that bring some relevancy to the topic, sir?",2025-02-05_biggs.txt

is going out. We are cutting spending at an executive level,
and I hope that we codify all of that here within these
chambers to ensure that it does not go out again.
Now, in your testimony, you also mentioned that DOGE
proposals reflect an agenda to dismantle professional
government. According to you, this is fundamentally at odds
with the principles of democratic governance. In November,
President Trump won by a decisive mandate, promising to
maximize governmental efficiency and productivity. And how are
our actions, these actions, fulfilling the President's campaign
promises fundamentally at odds with the principles of
democratic governance? And while my time is running out, I want
you to answer that, sir, but we hear about unelected folks.

those who are no longer going to be able to support their
businesses from American taxpayers. And we simply want
accountability. We want oversight. This is the Oversight
Committee and, unfortunately, Congress has done a crap job of
oversight and accountability over quite some time, I would say
decades, and that is why we have this new commission that is
created, and Americans are grateful for it. President Trump
campaigned on having this DOGE commission to have oversight and
accountability, and it is our responsibility to codify what
happens.
I am pleased with the expedited efforts that have taken
place to really get this out in the open and expose to the
American people what their money is actually being sent to, and
let us just be honest with the American people. Unelected
bureaucrats have been funneling their hard-earned taxpayer
dollars to ridiculous and even malicious causes. DOGE is doing
the hard work to uncover the truth and make our government work
for the people rather than funding policies that are actively
hurting them. For example, Dr. Resh, in your testimony you
state that the recommendations from the Department of
Government Efficiency will exacerbate public health crises. How
is that the case when DOGE is advocating to defund EcoHealth
Alliance which was involved in the research in the Wuhan Lab
that created coronavirus, that created this global pandemic
that killed people and ended the livelihoods of many others?",2025-02-05_boebert.txt

2025-02-05,boebert,"I think there has been a lot of
inefficiencies, and I am excited to see where this goes and the
exposure of that, and, Dr. Resh, the last Administration
weaponized NGOs to aid and abet illegal aliens across and
within the interior of the United States. We saw millions of
taxpayer dollars being funneled to NGOs that were spent on
plane and bus tickets, hotel rooms, and even to coach illegal
aliens on how to illegally stay in the country. Heck, we have a
Congresswoman who is currently coaching illegal aliens on how
to stay in the country, what terms to use, even if they are
untruthful. Now, Dr. Resh, how does transporting millions of
unvetted illegal aliens into our country make America safer,
and how does stopping the funding of those NGOs harm America?",2025-02-05_boebert.txt
2025-02-05,boebert,"Oh, it is not irrelevant. Let us go through
the list of relevancy, shall we? When we have open borders
allowing millions of illegal aliens coming into our country
unvetted, then the relevancy is in terms of Laken Riley,
Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Ruby Garcia, Lizbeth Medina,
and I could go on and on and on and on with the American
citizens who were killed at the hands of illegal aliens. So, I
think it is pretty relevant to say we need to look into these
NGOs and what they are doing with these unvetted illegal aliens
coming into our country and remaining into our country. Would
you agree? Does that bring some relevancy to the topic, sir?",2025-02-05_boebert.txt

President Trump won by a decisive mandate, promising to

tame the labyrinth of the Federal bureaucracy. That is why I

spending means less need for taxation on the American people.
My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed cuts
to waste, fraud, and abuse will include cuts to Social Security
and Medicare. However, promoting efficiency and cutting
wasteful spending actually protects Social Security and
Medicare by ensuring available and continued funding. And if
they have any more doubts, I would invite them to sign on to my
LASSO Act that actually puts these decisions out of the public
arm and into the public's domain.
When Elon Musk acquired Twitter, now X, in 2022, he fired
about 6,000 employees, or nearly 80 percent of his workforce,

tame the labyrinth of the Federal bureaucracy. That is why I
was elected, and, frankly, that is why President Trump was

spending means less need for taxation on the American people.
My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed cuts
to waste, fraud, and abuse will include cuts to Social Security
and Medicare. However, promoting efficiency and cutting
wasteful spending actually protects Social Security and
Medicare by ensuring available and continued funding. And if
they have any more doubts, I would invite them to sign on to my
LASSO Act that actually puts these decisions out of the public
arm and into the public's domain.
When Elon Musk acquired Twitter, now X, in 2022, he fired
about 6,000 employees, or nearly 80 percent of his workforce,

Now, in your testimony, you also mentioned that DOGE
proposals reflect an agenda to dismantle professional
government. According to you, this is fundamentally at odds
with the principles of democratic governance. In November,
President Trump won by a decisive mandate, promising to
maximize governmental efficiency and productivity. And how are
our actions, these actions, fulfilling the President's campaign
promises fundamentally at odds with the principles of
democratic governance? And while my time is running out, I want
you to answer that, sir, but we hear about unelected folks.
Democrats did not even get a chance to vote for their own
Presidential candidate in their primary, so do not talk to me
about unelected people actually being involved in the decisions
in this country. But I would like to hear how that is at odds,
sir.",2025-02-05_mace.txt

experiments and Federal-funded animal testing and worked with
you to prevent Fauci's plan to waste almost $2 million in

breeding center and testing site, Alpha Genesis. They have
made, to my understanding, over $100 million from NIH over the
last 20 or so years. This is a boondoggle. It is a racket, and
hundreds of millions of dollars--billions of dollars, in fact--
have been wasted on it. So, I want to thank you all for your

recognize my colleague, Ms. Brown, for 5 minutes.",2025-02-06_biggs.txt
2025-02-06,boebert,"Thank you, Madam Chair, and I appreciate your
advocacy on this and protecting so many animals against this,
as we have heard, savage research that has been taking place,
not only in the United States, but all throughout the world.
And I want to thank our witnesses today for your boldness to
come out because it seems like any time we expose millions and
billions, even, of dollars that are spent toward ridiculous
research programs or just organizations themselves, we are
lashed out at. We are called crazy and conspiracist, and I want
to thank you so much for taking a bold step.
I want to thank you for the White Coat Waste Project
because this is not only saving precious Beagles' lives but
really exposing to the American taxpayer where their money is
going, and I think we all want to be good stewards of our tax
money. We are responsible for those tax dollars here in
Congress, and it is our responsibility to be stewards and
overseers of that. So, I am grateful for DOGE to come in
alongside of us to help expose some of this and kind of get
those wheels turning.
But just for the folks back home real quick, before I get
into my questions, I want to just highlight, a million seconds
is 11-and-a-half days. A billion seconds is 31 years and 7
months. It is, like, this is a huge difference. When we are
talking about billions of dollars going toward the cruelty of
animals, it is much larger than what it sounds because it has
been so watered down to hear that Congress is spending millions
or billions or even trillions of dollars. God forbid if we find
out what comes after a trillion. We will start spending that,
too. But Mr. Goodman, since 1998, how much do you believe that
the Federal Government has spent on animal cruelty testing?",2025-02-06_biggs.txt

questions you want to ask. My first question, Mr. Goodman, what
is the worst animal testing experiment you have ever heard of

what is the absolute worst one you have ever heard of and
uncovered?",2025-02-06_biggs.txt

the prospects of a drug therapy that fails animal testing? Is
it likely to receive regulatory approval?",2025-02-06_biggs.txt
2025-02-06,boebert,"Thank you, Madam Chair. I think the NIH
probably should change their acronym to FOD--Faces of Death.
This very much sounds like a show that my mother would not let
me watch as a child and just hearing how egregious this is.
There are many more things that I have listed here. Of course,
we have heard of the beagles who were in the mesh cages. I do
not know if their vocal cords were paralyzed or if they were
removed, but they were prevented from barking, correct?",2025-02-06_biggs.txt

look forward to working with you. While we were just talking
offline here, I was saying I want to get on her bill about
cosmetics and animal testing, so all good things today. Today's
conversation builds upon the work that I and many of us on
Oversight and throughout Congress have been working on for
years to end animal testing. There are many of us up here, and
we are not working fast enough. We are trying as hard as we
can, so we appreciate the witnesses being here today.
Last Congress, I introduced the Preventing Animal Abuse and
Waste Act to prohibit the NIH from conducting or funding
research that causes significant pain or distress to cats or
dogs. As an animal lover, I have been disturbed to learn about
these barbaric and unnecessary experiments to create
transgender mice, rats, and monkeys. I, like many, most humans,
have a deep adoration and love for all of God's creatures,
including our animals, and one of my earliest memories as a
child was being in Hampton, South Carolina. I was, like, 4
years old, and my grandmother had just made some great biscuits
and breakfast, and she gave me this bright pink album, and it
was just full of pictures of animals from the newspaper from
Hampton, and ever since then, I have just loved them so much,
and I grew up with seven pets. We had three dogs, three cats,
and a parrot named Julio.
And so, it is just important for the work that we are doing
that all of God's creatures, all animals, are treated with
respect and dignity and love, and that they are not murdered
and maimed and killed on these horrific experiments. So, this
Congress, I will continue to fight to end all animal testing,
including by introducing legislation that prohibits use of
Federal funds for these cruel animal sex-change experiments.
Thank you, again, to our panelists. The issue of taxpayer-
funded animal cruelty deserves our time and attention. I am
thankful for your expert testimony today.

legislative days within which to submit materials and to submit

experiments and Federal-funded animal testing and worked with
you to prevent Fauci's plan to waste almost $2 million in

made, to my understanding, over $100 million from NIH over the
last 20 or so years. This is a boondoggle. It is a racket, and
hundreds of millions of dollars--billions of dollars, in fact--
have been wasted on it. So, I want to thank you all for your
testimony today. Thank you for being here. I would now like to
recognize my colleague, Ms. Brown, for 5 minutes.",2025-02-06_greene.txt
2025-02-06,boebert,"Thank you, Madam Chair, and I appreciate your
advocacy on this and protecting so many animals against this,
as we have heard, savage research that has been taking place,
not only in the United States, but all throughout the world.
And I want to thank our witnesses today for your boldness to
come out because it seems like any time we expose millions and
billions, even, of dollars that are spent toward ridiculous
research programs or just organizations themselves, we are
lashed out at. We are called crazy and conspiracist, and I want
to thank you so much for taking a bold step.
I want to thank you for the White Coat Waste Project
because this is not only saving precious Beagles' lives but
really exposing to the American taxpayer where their money is
going, and I think we all want to be good stewards of our tax
money. We are responsible for those tax dollars here in
Congress, and it is our responsibility to be stewards and
overseers of that. So, I am grateful for DOGE to come in
alongside of us to help expose some of this and kind of get
those wheels turning.
But just for the folks back home real quick, before I get
into my questions, I want to just highlight, a million seconds
is 11-and-a-half days. A billion seconds is 31 years and 7
months. It is, like, this is a huge difference. When we are
talking about billions of dollars going toward the cruelty of
animals, it is much larger than what it sounds because it has
been so watered down to hear that Congress is spending millions
or billions or even trillions of dollars. God forbid if we find
out what comes after a trillion. We will start spending that,
too. But Mr. Goodman, since 1998, how much do you believe that
the Federal Government has spent on animal cruelty testing?",2025-02-06_greene.txt

is the worst animal testing experiment you have ever heard of

what is the absolute worst one you have ever heard of and
uncovered?",2025-02-06_greene.txt

the prospects of a drug therapy that fails animal testing? Is

probably should change their acronym to FOD--Faces of Death.

me watch as a child and just hearing how egregious this is.

we have heard of the beagles who were in the mesh cages. I do
not know if their vocal cords were paralyzed or if they were
removed, but they were prevented from barking, correct?",2025-02-06_greene.txt

look forward to working with you. While we were just talking
offline here, I was saying I want to get on her bill about
cosmetics and animal testing, so all good things today. Today's
conversation builds upon the work that I and many of us on
Oversight and throughout Congress have been working on for
years to end animal testing. There are many of us up here, and
we are not working fast enough. We are trying as hard as we
can, so we appreciate the witnesses being here today.
Last Congress, I introduced the Preventing Animal Abuse and
Waste Act to prohibit the NIH from conducting or funding
research that causes significant pain or distress to cats or
dogs. As an animal lover, I have been disturbed to learn about
these barbaric and unnecessary experiments to create
transgender mice, rats, and monkeys. I, like many, most humans,
have a deep adoration and love for all of God's creatures,
including our animals, and one of my earliest memories as a
child was being in Hampton, South Carolina. I was, like, 4
years old, and my grandmother had just made some great biscuits
and breakfast, and she gave me this bright pink album, and it
was just full of pictures of animals from the newspaper from
Hampton, and ever since then, I have just loved them so much,
and I grew up with seven pets. We had three dogs, three cats,
and a parrot named Julio.
And so, it is just important for the work that we are doing
that all of God's creatures, all animals, are treated with
respect and dignity and love, and that they are not murdered
and maimed and killed on these horrific experiments. So, this
Congress, I will continue to fight to end all animal testing,
including by introducing legislation that prohibits use of
Federal funds for these cruel animal sex-change experiments.
Thank you, again, to our panelists. The issue of taxpayer-
funded animal cruelty deserves our time and attention. I am
thankful for your expert testimony today.

that their identity can be stolen and then used for child-
trafficking, drug-trafficking, and terrorism, like you stated
in your opening statement. Ms. Royal, your testimony states
that many programs operate under essentially an honor system in
which applicants need not verify their identity, income,
residency, or other key eligibility factors. You call this a
trust-everyone instead of a trust-by-verify approach. Does this
mean the Federal Government and some states are giving out
billions of dollars to individuals without verifying who they
are or whether they meet program eligibility requirements?",2025-02-12_mace.txt

to our witnesses here who came to testify on border policies
and technologies.
I was excited to see President Trump put out a post, a
truth, on Truth Social, that said, ``The month of February, my
first full month in office, had the lowest number of illegal
immigrants trying to enter our country in history by far. There
were only 8,326 apprehensions of illegals by Border Patrol at
the U.S. Mexico border, all of whom were quickly ejected from
our Nation or, when necessary, prosecuted for crimes against
the United States of America. This means that very few people
came. The invasion of our country is over. In comparison, under
Joe Biden, there were 300,000 illegals crossing in 1 month, and
virtually all of them were released into our country. Thanks to
the Trump Administration policies, the border is closed to all
illegal aliens.'' ``Immigrants'' is what he what he put.
``Anyone who tries to illegally enter the U.S.A. will face
significant criminal penalties and immediate deportation.'' I
think the President Trump and his team, Secretary Noem and
border czar, Tom Homan, have done a fantastic job of turning
chaos at our southern border into control.",2025-03-04_biggs.txt

makes our borders more or less secure?",2025-03-04_biggs.txt

A HEARING WITH SANCTUARY CITY MAYORS
----------
Wednesday, March 5, 2025",2025-03-05_boebert.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mayor Mike Johnston,
I hope we can start off on a level-field of agreement here. So,
in your testimony, you said that locals were asking Denver what
will you do when they saw 10 to 11 buses coming in a day and
42,000 illegal aliens entering their city. Denver, what will
you do? And in a Fox31 interview in January, you blamed state
law for not allowing the city of Denver to coordinate with ICE,
resulting in Denver being a sanctuary city, saying, ``The whole
state is bound by our state law in this, which is pretty
consistent in some of these practices. Like, everywhere in the
state, we do not honor ICE detainers.'' I have demanded
Governor Jared Polis and the Colorado State Legislature to
repeal them. Douglas County has led on a lawsuit to get those
laws repealed. So, Mr. Mayor, would you join me today in
calling and demanding that these sanctuary policies, these
Colorado state laws be repealed?",2025-03-05_boebert.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Yes or no, Mr. Mayor.",2025-03-05_boebert.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Yes or no, will you join me?",2025-03-05_boebert.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"What about before a warrant? There are many
issues before a warrant.",2025-03-05_boebert.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Well, you have local law enforcement officers,",2025-03-05_boebert.txt

EPA, a Federal employee?",2025-03-05_boebert.txt

they get fired for talking with someone from Health and Human

Federal law enforcement officers?",2025-03-05_boebert.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,This is an ordinance----,2025-03-05_boebert.txt

prior to the warrant.",2025-03-05_boebert.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Because you do not know if they are illegal
because you are unable to coordinate until there is a warrant,
so that is why this ordinance needs to be repealed. So now, in
600 days, there has been no time to ask for this to be
repealed. You did have a Newcomers Playbook, 25 pages. You had
time to put that together, and you had time to agree with the
city council to authorize up to $2 million to pay Joe Biden's
former lawyer, his law firm, to help cover your ass for
Denver's sanctuary city policies for this hearing, correct?",2025-03-05_boebert.txt

Well, Aurora's crime went up because you were also shipping
them to Aurora, and we have documentation that I do not have
time to discuss here in this hearing that proves you were
shipping illegal aliens to Aurora. Their crime was increasing
while you were hiding under laws that you will not demand be
repealed--ordinance from your city----",2025-03-05_boebert.txt

showing up at your house tomorrow with my bags at 5. Leave your
doors unlocked, please. What are you making for dinner because
I expect a new warm meal and a balanced diet. Now, I am going
to need a car, and please leave me some cash because I am going
to need to go to my doctor's appointment on Friday. That would
be to Mayor Johnson. Now, I do not want to sleep on the couch,
so put me up at a luxury hotel. Another to Mayor Johnson.
Obviously, you would not like this because you do not know me,
right? You know nothing about me. You might not like that.
Sanctuary cities offer this kind of hope, this false hope to
illegal aliens by saying that very thing. Stay with me. We do
not tell anybody that you break our laws. Now, thank you. You
have made the United States complicit and one of the largest
purveyors of human trafficking in the world. Thank you. You are
disgracing the legal immigration system and the immigrants that
came here the right way through Ellis Island at the time, now
going through a process.
And I want to talk about that process because I have always
been told, and it has never been really challenged, is that
good process builds good policy, builds good politics. I think
that works really, really good because you can always fall back
to the process. If the process is not good, you always get a
bad process. Now, you heard the word ``establishing trust,''
OK? How can you establish trust at the very beginning when you
have a false narrative here? You are defending folks who have
broken the law. The definition I have always looked at is trust
is a series of promises kept. What kind of trust you are
supporting here? What is the trust in an illegal alien? It is a
false hope. It is a false trust. Welcome, we are bringing you

2025-03-05,boebert,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mayor Mike Johnston,
I hope we can start off on a level-field of agreement here. So,
in your testimony, you said that locals were asking Denver what
will you do when they saw 10 to 11 buses coming in a day and
42,000 illegal aliens entering their city. Denver, what will
you do? And in a Fox31 interview in January, you blamed state
law for not allowing the city of Denver to coordinate with ICE,
resulting in Denver being a sanctuary city, saying, ``The whole
state is bound by our state law in this, which is pretty
consistent in some of these practices. Like, everywhere in the
state, we do not honor ICE detainers.'' I have demanded
Governor Jared Polis and the Colorado State Legislature to
repeal them. Douglas County has led on a lawsuit to get those
laws repealed. So, Mr. Mayor, would you join me today in
calling and demanding that these sanctuary policies, these
Colorado state laws be repealed?",2025-03-05_gosar.txt

A HEARING WITH SANCTUARY CITY MAYORS
----------
Wednesday, March 5, 2025",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mayor Mike Johnston,
I hope we can start off on a level-field of agreement here. So,
in your testimony, you said that locals were asking Denver what
will you do when they saw 10 to 11 buses coming in a day and
42,000 illegal aliens entering their city. Denver, what will
you do? And in a Fox31 interview in January, you blamed state
law for not allowing the city of Denver to coordinate with ICE,
resulting in Denver being a sanctuary city, saying, ``The whole
state is bound by our state law in this, which is pretty
consistent in some of these practices. Like, everywhere in the
state, we do not honor ICE detainers.'' I have demanded
Governor Jared Polis and the Colorado State Legislature to
repeal them. Douglas County has led on a lawsuit to get those
laws repealed. So, Mr. Mayor, would you join me today in
calling and demanding that these sanctuary policies, these
Colorado state laws be repealed?",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Yes or no, Mr. Mayor.",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Yes or no, will you join me?",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"What about before a warrant? There are many
issues before a warrant.",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Well, you have local law enforcement officers,",2025-03-05_greene.txt

communicating and coordinating, talking with, an agent from the

2025-03-05,boebert,"What about Health and Human Services? Would
they get fired for talking with someone from Health and Human
Services?",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"So, they would only be fired for talking to
Federal law enforcement officers?",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,This is an ordinance----,2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"No, we are talking before the warrants, Mr.",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Only if there is a warrant, but I am talking
prior to the warrant.",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Because you do not know if they are illegal
because you are unable to coordinate until there is a warrant,
so that is why this ordinance needs to be repealed. So now, in
600 days, there has been no time to ask for this to be
repealed. You did have a Newcomers Playbook, 25 pages. You had
time to put that together, and you had time to agree with the
city council to authorize up to $2 million to pay Joe Biden's
former lawyer, his law firm, to help cover your ass for
Denver's sanctuary city policies for this hearing, correct?",2025-03-05_greene.txt

Well, Aurora's crime went up because you were also shipping
them to Aurora, and we have documentation that I do not have
time to discuss here in this hearing that proves you were
shipping illegal aliens to Aurora. Their crime was increasing
while you were hiding under laws that you will not demand be
repealed--ordinance from your city----",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I hope that we
can get this resolved for Colorado.",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Yes, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask
unanimous consent to submit to the record multiple local news
articles referencing Denver's sanctuary policies, including the
``Newcomers Playbook,'' written by Mayor Adams, and the budget,
which shows millions and millions of dollars of the Denver City
budget cut.",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mayor Wu, I will be
showing up at your house tomorrow with my bags at 5. Leave your
doors unlocked, please. What are you making for dinner because
I expect a new warm meal and a balanced diet. Now, I am going
to need a car, and please leave me some cash because I am going
to need to go to my doctor's appointment on Friday. That would
be to Mayor Johnson. Now, I do not want to sleep on the couch,
so put me up at a luxury hotel. Another to Mayor Johnson.
Obviously, you would not like this because you do not know me,
right? You know nothing about me. You might not like that.
Sanctuary cities offer this kind of hope, this false hope to
illegal aliens by saying that very thing. Stay with me. We do
not tell anybody that you break our laws. Now, thank you. You
have made the United States complicit and one of the largest
purveyors of human trafficking in the world. Thank you. You are
disgracing the legal immigration system and the immigrants that
came here the right way through Ellis Island at the time, now
going through a process.
And I want to talk about that process because I have always
been told, and it has never been really challenged, is that
good process builds good policy, builds good politics. I think
that works really, really good because you can always fall back
to the process. If the process is not good, you always get a
bad process. Now, you heard the word ``establishing trust,''
OK? How can you establish trust at the very beginning when you
have a false narrative here? You are defending folks who have
broken the law. The definition I have always looked at is trust
is a series of promises kept. What kind of trust you are
supporting here? What is the trust in an illegal alien? It is a
false hope. It is a false trust. Welcome, we are bringing you
in. It is a disorganized process.
Now, let me ask you a question, Mr. Adams. Did you support
SB 1070?",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,Did you support the Arizona law called SB 1070?,2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"Well, let me explain, OK?",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"SB 1070 challenged the Federal Government and
its supremacy clause because we, in Arizona, the government was
not doing anything, so we thought we will do this. We cannot
allow them to break laws, and the Supreme Court ruled, struck
it down. Now, it seems contraindicating here that you would
have supported SB 1070, right, Mayor Adams, based on the
promise that you, or would you violate the supremacy clause in
regard to immigration?",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,Violate the supremacy clause?,2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"Mayor Johnston, would you have supported SB
1070, allowing Arizona to follow their own laws because that is
what you are doing right here.",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"What happens when you get in conflict with them?
Who do you support?",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,What would you have?,2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,biggs,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, Mayor Adams--sorry,
over here--you have agreed today that New York City is a
sanctuary city. Is that right?",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,biggs,"Right, but that is what you have proclaimed.
Mayor Johnston, you have previously also declared that you are
a sanctuary city. Mayor Johnson, you said that Chicago must
lead with and live by the promise to be a sanctuary city. Mayor
Wu, you said Boston police and other departments cannot
cooperate with ICE when it comes to detaining on civil
warrants. Of course, I do not know what Mayor Johnston would
define it, but I do know that the Honorable Mayor Johnston from
Chicago, they call theirs a Welcoming City ordinance, and we
have got Ms. Wu, Mayor Wu, who has referred to hers as a safe
city. That is really interesting to me.
So, when you are a sanctuary city, you put limits on how
much you are willing to cooperate with Federal agencies'
efforts to remove illegal aliens, and your policies then
contravene Federal law. You just do. Under Title 8 of the U.S.
Code, it says, ``A Federal, state, or local government entity
or official may not prohibit or in any way restrict any
government entity or official from sending to or receiving from
the Immigration Naturalization Service any information
regarding citizenship or immigration status of any
individual.''
So, when I look at your guys' ordinances, and I got them
all up here, and they are really interesting stuff, in Denver,
I think you testified previously that you rely on the statutory
section--am I right--of the state statute, so let us just
review this. There is a distinction, and some of you have made
that. Mayor Johnston of Chicago made this repeatedly, and Mayor",2025-03-05_greene.txt
2025-03-05,mace,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All of the mayors here
today are actively working to harm the American people you
represent. You all have blood on your hands. I am going to ask
a series of yes or no questions today, and I would like to
remind all of you, you are under oath. I only want a yes or no
to my questions.

A HEARING WITH SANCTUARY CITY MAYORS
----------
Wednesday, March 5, 2025",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mayor Mike Johnston,
I hope we can start off on a level-field of agreement here. So,
in your testimony, you said that locals were asking Denver what
will you do when they saw 10 to 11 buses coming in a day and
42,000 illegal aliens entering their city. Denver, what will
you do? And in a Fox31 interview in January, you blamed state
law for not allowing the city of Denver to coordinate with ICE,
resulting in Denver being a sanctuary city, saying, ``The whole
state is bound by our state law in this, which is pretty
consistent in some of these practices. Like, everywhere in the
state, we do not honor ICE detainers.'' I have demanded
Governor Jared Polis and the Colorado State Legislature to
repeal them. Douglas County has led on a lawsuit to get those
laws repealed. So, Mr. Mayor, would you join me today in
calling and demanding that these sanctuary policies, these
Colorado state laws be repealed?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Yes or no, Mr. Mayor.",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Yes or no, will you join me?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"What about before a warrant? There are many
issues before a warrant.",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Well, you have local law enforcement officers,",2025-03-05_mace.txt

EPA, a Federal employee?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"What about Health and Human Services? Would
they get fired for talking with someone from Health and Human
Services?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"So, they would only be fired for talking to
Federal law enforcement officers?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,This is an ordinance----,2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"No, we are talking before the warrants, Mr.",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Only if there is a warrant, but I am talking
prior to the warrant.",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Because you do not know if they are illegal
because you are unable to coordinate until there is a warrant,
so that is why this ordinance needs to be repealed. So now, in
600 days, there has been no time to ask for this to be
repealed. You did have a Newcomers Playbook, 25 pages. You had
time to put that together, and you had time to agree with the
city council to authorize up to $2 million to pay Joe Biden's
former lawyer, his law firm, to help cover your ass for
Denver's sanctuary city policies for this hearing, correct?",2025-03-05_mace.txt

2025-03-05,boebert,"So, I have heard that Denver crime went down.
Well, Aurora's crime went up because you were also shipping
them to Aurora, and we have documentation that I do not have
time to discuss here in this hearing that proves you were
shipping illegal aliens to Aurora. Their crime was increasing
while you were hiding under laws that you will not demand be
repealed--ordinance from your city----",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I hope that we
can get this resolved for Colorado.",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,boebert,"Yes, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask
unanimous consent to submit to the record multiple local news
articles referencing Denver's sanctuary policies, including the
``Newcomers Playbook,'' written by Mayor Adams, and the budget,
which shows millions and millions of dollars of the Denver City
budget cut.",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mayor Wu, I will be
showing up at your house tomorrow with my bags at 5. Leave your
doors unlocked, please. What are you making for dinner because
I expect a new warm meal and a balanced diet. Now, I am going
to need a car, and please leave me some cash because I am going
to need to go to my doctor's appointment on Friday. That would
be to Mayor Johnson. Now, I do not want to sleep on the couch,
so put me up at a luxury hotel. Another to Mayor Johnson.
Obviously, you would not like this because you do not know me,
right? You know nothing about me. You might not like that.
Sanctuary cities offer this kind of hope, this false hope to
illegal aliens by saying that very thing. Stay with me. We do
not tell anybody that you break our laws. Now, thank you. You
have made the United States complicit and one of the largest
purveyors of human trafficking in the world. Thank you. You are
disgracing the legal immigration system and the immigrants that
came here the right way through Ellis Island at the time, now
going through a process.
And I want to talk about that process because I have always
been told, and it has never been really challenged, is that
good process builds good policy, builds good politics. I think
that works really, really good because you can always fall back
to the process. If the process is not good, you always get a
bad process. Now, you heard the word ``establishing trust,''
OK? How can you establish trust at the very beginning when you
have a false narrative here? You are defending folks who have
broken the law. The definition I have always looked at is trust
is a series of promises kept. What kind of trust you are
supporting here? What is the trust in an illegal alien? It is a
false hope. It is a false trust. Welcome, we are bringing you
in. It is a disorganized process.
Now, let me ask you a question, Mr. Adams. Did you support
SB 1070?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,Did you support the Arizona law called SB 1070?,2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"Well, let me explain, OK?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"SB 1070 challenged the Federal Government and
its supremacy clause because we, in Arizona, the government was
not doing anything, so we thought we will do this. We cannot
allow them to break laws, and the Supreme Court ruled, struck
it down. Now, it seems contraindicating here that you would
have supported SB 1070, right, Mayor Adams, based on the
promise that you, or would you violate the supremacy clause in
regard to immigration?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,Violate the supremacy clause?,2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"Mayor Johnston, would you have supported SB
1070, allowing Arizona to follow their own laws because that is
what you are doing right here.",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,"What happens when you get in conflict with them?
Who do you support?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,gosar,What would you have?,2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,biggs,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So, Mayor Adams--sorry,
over here--you have agreed today that New York City is a
sanctuary city. Is that right?",2025-03-05_mace.txt
2025-03-05,biggs,"Right, but that is what you have proclaimed.
Mayor Johnston, you have previously also declared that you are
a sanctuary city. Mayor Johnson, you said that Chicago must
lead with and live by the promise to be a sanctuary city. Mayor
Wu, you said Boston police and other departments cannot
cooperate with ICE when it comes to detaining on civil
warrants. Of course, I do not know what Mayor Johnston would
define it, but I do know that the Honorable Mayor Johnston from
Chicago, they call theirs a Welcoming City ordinance, and we
have got Ms. Wu, Mayor Wu, who has referred to hers as a safe
city. That is really interesting to me.
So, when you are a sanctuary city, you put limits on how
much you are willing to cooperate with Federal agencies'
efforts to remove illegal aliens, and your policies then
contravene Federal law. You just do. Under Title 8 of the U.S.
Code, it says, ``A Federal, state, or local government entity
or official may not prohibit or in any way restrict any
government entity or official from sending to or receiving from
the Immigration Naturalization Service any information
regarding citizenship or immigration status of any
individual.''
So, when I look at your guys' ordinances, and I got them
all up here, and they are really interesting stuff, in Denver,
I think you testified previously that you rely on the statutory
section--am I right--of the state statute, so let us just
review this. There is a distinction, and some of you have made
that. Mayor Johnston of Chicago made this repeatedly, and Mayor",2025-03-05_mace.txt

today are actively working to harm the American people you

Boy'' was aired about a trans teen navigating adolescent
sobriety and the ramification of his gender identity. In 2022,
the same series aired ``Our League'', in which a trans woman
comes to her old school Ohio bowling league in a story about
transition. Then in 2024, ``Racist Trees'' was aired telling a
story of how in Palm Springs, a Black neighborhood fights to
remove a divisive wall of trees. Do you think PBS needs to fund

United States is $36 trillion in debt. In Fiscal Year 2024, the
government spent over $1.8 trillion more than it took in, and
in Fiscal Year 2025, the interest on our debt is expected to
exceed $1 trillion. As we continue investigating waste, fraud,
and abuse, and we can look no further than the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting, the LGBTQ indoctrination of our children,
the systematic racism narrative, and the support for censorship
being pushed by the heads of NPR and PBS are just several of
the many abuses of taxpayer dollars. And if you are one of the
select few who might support such content, you can personally
support and fund it with your own money through private
donations because the reality is the United States of America
is broke and cannot afford it.
And after all, PBS and NPR are already fundraising off of
this Committee hearing. The American people are closely
following along today in this long-awaited hearing to hear the
case for why Americans hard-earned tax dollars should continue
for public broadcasting. I think from what we have heard here
today, the American people will not continue to allow such
propaganda to be funded through the Federal Government with
their hard-earned tax dollars. The Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, that we give over half a billion dollars to, no
longer serves the public. It serves a narrow audience of
wealthy, liberal elites who are out of touch with everyday",2025-03-26_mace.txt

children ages three to eight should ever be watching--a grown,
biological man posing as a woman. And by the way, Ms. Kerger,
that was aired on April 1, 2021, and then something happened.
It was not an accident and it was not just for a brief time
that it was up. It was aired April 1, and then somehow it
expired May 24. Later on, it was taken down. I wonder why that
was taken down.
Another egregious example includes back in 2010, PBS' Tavis
Smiley stated that Christians blow up people every single day.
I have not seen that ever happen in my life. And today, if you
look on NPR's website, there is still zero mention of any
negative coverage of any Democrat today, and trust us, there
are more than plenty of examples to pull from. How about a

Today, we conducted oversight of our Nation's national
governing body for the sport of fencing, and with so many of
our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.
Earlier today, the Ranking Member called us weird for
standing up for girls and women when she is the one who
supports sex change surgeries for little kids and forcing women
to undress in front of creepy, perverted men. I will let the
American people decide who the weirdos are because I think we
know.
The American people are tired of cultural Marxism and
perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,
especially when it is being done with our own tax dollars. The
issue of men competing in women's sports should not even have
to be a discussion. It is unfair, unsafe, and straight-up
abusive.
As Board Chair of USA Fencing, Mr. Lehfeldt has used his
position to push his own personal trans agenda on the sport. As
a matter of fact, Liz Kocab is the most decorated American
veteran fencer in history, and that is a man, a biological man
who is a ninth career gold medalist.",2025-05-07_biggs.txt

one to suffer a life-altering physical injury from a volleyball
spike to her head. The other was thrown out of a recent fencing
competition for refusing to compete against a man.
Why is this happening when we have Federal laws on the
books intended to foster women's sports? Back in 1972, Congress
adopted Title IX to create and protect equal athletic
opportunity for girls and women in schools and colleges.

Today, we conducted oversight of our Nation's national
governing body for the sport of fencing, and with so many of
our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.
Earlier today, the Ranking Member called us weird for
standing up for girls and women when she is the one who
supports sex change surgeries for little kids and forcing women
to undress in front of creepy, perverted men. I will let the
American people decide who the weirdos are because I think we
know.
The American people are tired of cultural Marxism and
perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,
especially when it is being done with our own tax dollars. The
issue of men competing in women's sports should not even have
to be a discussion. It is unfair, unsafe, and straight-up
abusive.
As Board Chair of USA Fencing, Mr. Lehfeldt has used his
position to push his own personal trans agenda on the sport. As
a matter of fact, Liz Kocab is the most decorated American
veteran fencer in history, and that is a man, a biological man
who is a ninth career gold medalist.",2025-05-07_boebert.txt

competition for refusing to compete against a man.
Why is this happening when we have Federal laws on the

Today, we conducted oversight of our Nation's national
governing body for the sport of fencing, and with so many of
our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.
Earlier today, the Ranking Member called us weird for
standing up for girls and women when she is the one who
supports sex change surgeries for little kids and forcing women
to undress in front of creepy, perverted men. I will let the
American people decide who the weirdos are because I think we
know.
The American people are tired of cultural Marxism and
perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,
especially when it is being done with our own tax dollars. The
issue of men competing in women's sports should not even have
to be a discussion. It is unfair, unsafe, and straight-up
abusive.
As Board Chair of USA Fencing, Mr. Lehfeldt has used his
position to push his own personal trans agenda on the sport. As
a matter of fact, Liz Kocab is the most decorated American
veteran fencer in history, and that is a man, a biological man
who is a ninth career gold medalist.",2025-05-07_gosar.txt

competition for refusing to compete against a man.
Why is this happening when we have Federal laws on the

battle, and that was proven in the last election.
Today, we conducted oversight of our Nation's national
governing body for the sport of fencing, and with so many of
our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.
Earlier today, the Ranking Member called us weird for
standing up for girls and women when she is the one who
supports sex change surgeries for little kids and forcing women
to undress in front of creepy, perverted men. I will let the
American people decide who the weirdos are because I think we
know.
The American people are tired of cultural Marxism and
perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,
especially when it is being done with our own tax dollars. The
issue of men competing in women's sports should not even have
to be a discussion. It is unfair, unsafe, and straight-up
abusive.
As Board Chair of USA Fencing, Mr. Lehfeldt has used his
position to push his own personal trans agenda on the sport. As
a matter of fact, Liz Kocab is the most decorated American
veteran fencer in history, and that is a man, a biological man
who is a ninth career gold medalist.",2025-05-07_greene.txt

Today, we conducted oversight of our Nation's national
governing body for the sport of fencing, and with so many of
our Nation's institutions, USA Fencing has been captured by the
left. They banned the national anthem before competitions,
selected tournament competition locations based on state
abortion and DEI laws, and punished female athletes for
refusing to compete against men.
Earlier today, the Ranking Member called us weird for
standing up for girls and women when she is the one who
supports sex change surgeries for little kids and forcing women
to undress in front of creepy, perverted men. I will let the
American people decide who the weirdos are because I think we
know.
The American people are tired of cultural Marxism and
perverted sexual ideas being shoved down their throats,
especially when it is being done with our own tax dollars. The
issue of men competing in women's sports should not even have
to be a discussion. It is unfair, unsafe, and straight-up
abusive.

For decades, elements in our government have engaged in an

inconvenient it is to elites, organized crime, or deep state
bureaucrats, the American people deserve the truth, and they
can handle the truth.
While the American public still may be in the dark, poll
after poll made clear the cover-up has failed. Approximately
two-thirds of Americans still do not buy the official narrative
from our government that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Cover-
ups and a failure to be transparent has rightfully bred
distrust, so much distrust nearly 40 percent of Americans
believe the U.S. Government was involved in the assassination
of JFK. Let that sink in--nearly 40 percent.

While the American public still may be in the dark, poll

two-thirds of Americans still do not buy the official narrative
from our government that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Cover-
ups and a failure to be transparent has rightfully bred
distrust, so much distrust nearly 40 percent of Americans

So, I have questions, I think, for most of you, and I need
a quick response, if I can. But, first, I will ask ultimately
of all of you the question, why? Why did this move the way it
did?
So, Dr. Curtis, you observed the back of President",2025-05-20_mace.txt
2025-05-20,biggs,"Oh, I am sorry. I will speak up. I will try to
be louder.
You indicated that you had no doubt that the wound that you
observed to the back of President Kennedy's head was an exit
gunshot wound. Is that fair?",2025-05-20_mace.txt
2025-05-20,biggs,"And you concluded, after review, that it did not
align--his wound did not align with the theory that Lee Harvey
Oswald acted alone in shooting President Kennedy. Is that true?",2025-05-20_mace.txt
2025-05-20,biggs,"And I guess you struggle to this day to
understand the Warren Commission's theory about the President's
shooter and how it seems to have discord with what you actually
observed that day. Is that fair to say?",2025-05-20_mace.txt

cannot--Mr. Joannides?",2025-05-20_mace.txt

to the Chair, that we see if we can get Mr. Joannides' file
released.
And I would like to continue on--I only have two and a half
minutes. But I have to get to the ultimate question: Why? Why,
why did the CIA intervene with Mr. Hardway's review? Why were
documents altered? Why was the Zapruder film removed and not
brought back in its original documented form? Why?",2025-05-20_mace.txt

saying, Madam Chair----",2025-05-20_mace.txt

And then also referencing the Joannides file, so everyone
is tracking, we are actively trying to track that down. I
believe that that is the one outstanding document that the CIA
will not be able to find. So, isn't that interesting?",2025-05-20_mace.txt

For decades, elements in our government have engaged in an
extensive cover-up to subvert the will of Congress and to keep
the American public in the dark relating to the assassination
of John F. Kennedy. No matter how ugly it is or how
inconvenient it is to elites, organized crime, or deep state
bureaucrats, the American people deserve the truth, and they
can handle the truth.
While the American public still may be in the dark, poll
after poll made clear the cover-up has failed. Approximately
two-thirds of Americans still do not buy the official narrative
from our government that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. Cover-
ups and a failure to be transparent has rightfully bred
distrust, so much distrust nearly 40 percent of Americans
believe the U.S. Government was involved in the assassination
of JFK. Let that sink in--nearly 40 percent.

2025-06-05,gosar,"Thanks, Chairwoman. Ms. Miller, you described
the COVID process as a catastrophic event with a high risk of
fraud. I agree. I am the only non-U.S. resident in the United
States to have ever killed a national emergency. I killed
COVID, but there is not a single receipt, though, and since
Bill Clinton through Joe Biden, we have spent over $13
trillion--let me say that again--$13 trillion without a
receipt. Could we use AI to examine the funds spent under
COVID?",2025-06-05_biggs.txt

My understanding, there was over 2,000 cases in Arizona alone,
that entities or individuals were actually sued by the
government to get it back, resulting in compensation of over
$300 million. We could use that as well, if it disappeared?
Once again, this is based on the data, right?",2025-06-05_biggs.txt

some kind of technology that will help preserve some of this
data or save us?",2025-06-05_biggs.txt

2025-06-05,mace,"Thank you, and I will now recognize myself for 5
minutes. I want to thank our participants and panelists and
witnesses today for being here.
One of my concerns, coming from a technology background,
like, I learned COBOL back in 1999, and a lot of our systems
today, they are on legacy systems. We waste a lot of money on
that, and then with the advent of AI and how fast technology is
moving, you know, the Federal Government has real challenges
with moving forward in a quick way and competing against our
adversaries. So, this is my first question to all the panelists
this afternoon, is if you could just do one thing that could
advance the Federal Government in any way, any agency, any
capability, if you could just do one thing today to help us
utilize AI and technology to move the ball forward, what is
that? What is the one thing you would do? Does not have to be
something big. It could be a small part that makes a big
difference. But what is that one thing you would do right now,
if we could do it tomorrow, snap our fingers? What is it?",2025-06-05_biggs.txt
2025-06-05,mace,"Thank you so much, and I yield back. I will now
yield to Ms. Lee for 5 minutes.",2025-06-05_biggs.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"[Presiding.] The gentlelady yields. I now
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I
will start with you. Do you support federalism? Yes or no?",2025-06-05_biggs.txt

one side, state rights or none. Mr. Schneier?",2025-06-05_biggs.txt

2025-06-05,greene,No? Mr. Schneier?,2025-06-05_biggs.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"No, you cannot. In the state of Georgia, jobs
are extremely important, and AI is, whether we like it or not,
and it is helpful in many ways, and it is not helpful, will
replace jobs. I have a manufacturing district, and the
manufacturing companies are important, but so are the people's
jobs. And if our state cannot regulate or make laws to protect
people's jobs, people are going to go hungry. They are not
going to have paychecks. They are not going to put roofs over
their families' heads. And I think this is such a serious
issue, that we need to look at this through--I will state it
very clearly, I am pro humanity. I am not pro transhumanity.
And when it comes to AI and regulation, when we get to vote on
this bill again, I will be voting no because of this clause,
and we will be working on this further. Thank you so much for
being here today. I now yield to Ms. Simon.",2025-06-05_biggs.txt

2025-06-05,luna,"Thank you, Madam Chair. You know, I want to
thank you all for being here today. One of the biggest concerns
I have with this whole discussion on AI is a failure to admit,
first and foremost, that it does appear that in the next 10
years, that the way that we have grown up and know life with AI
will be forever changing. With that being said, there are a few
differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think
that that is a very serious topic that needs to be discussed
right now.
But specifically, to transhumanism and coupling of AI with
humanity, what regulatory frameworks can be established to
ensure AI-driven transhumanist technologies, like brain-
computer interfaces prioritize human safety and consent? I am
opening this up to everyone on the panel. I have a few
questions, so I would like to get through this, so just please
limit your responses. Mr. B, if you want to go first, or down
there, either/or.",2025-06-05_biggs.txt
2025-06-05,luna,"Is there the possibility of regulation, though,
that exists that would enable transhumanist enhancements that
exacerbate social inequalities or basically financial
inequalities, creating an elite class of enhanced individuals?
I bring that up because we are talking about low-level jobs
potentially being removed from the workforce, people that have
and can afford the ability of, for example, implementing or
implanting chips, given access to unknown amounts of, you know,
knowledge, and essentially creating the first superhuman, and
this is a real concern. I know it might come across as funny to
other people, but I am genuinely concerned about this.
You know, from a bipartisan perspective here, we are
talking about humanity versus machine. Hopefully, in a flowery
world, we would have it set up to where it could, you know,
improve society for the best, but I am also in politics, and I
have a very, unfortunately, sometimes negative perspective on
the world because I have seen the worst of humanity in this

the COVID process as a catastrophic event with a high risk of
fraud. I agree. I am the only non-U.S. resident in the United
States to have ever killed a national emergency. I killed
COVID, but there is not a single receipt, though, and since
Bill Clinton through Joe Biden, we have spent over $13
trillion--let me say that again--$13 trillion without a
receipt. Could we use AI to examine the funds spent under
COVID?",2025-06-05_boebert.txt

2025-06-05,mace,"Thank you, and I will now recognize myself for 5
minutes. I want to thank our participants and panelists and
witnesses today for being here.
One of my concerns, coming from a technology background,
like, I learned COBOL back in 1999, and a lot of our systems
today, they are on legacy systems. We waste a lot of money on
that, and then with the advent of AI and how fast technology is
moving, you know, the Federal Government has real challenges
with moving forward in a quick way and competing against our
adversaries. So, this is my first question to all the panelists
this afternoon, is if you could just do one thing that could
advance the Federal Government in any way, any agency, any
capability, if you could just do one thing today to help us
utilize AI and technology to move the ball forward, what is
that? What is the one thing you would do? Does not have to be
something big. It could be a small part that makes a big
difference. But what is that one thing you would do right now,
if we could do it tomorrow, snap our fingers? What is it?",2025-06-05_boebert.txt
2025-06-05,mace,"Thank you so much, and I yield back. I will now
yield to Ms. Lee for 5 minutes.",2025-06-05_boebert.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"[Presiding.] The gentlelady yields. I now
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I
will start with you. Do you support federalism? Yes or no?",2025-06-05_boebert.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"Yes, Mr. Thierer?",2025-06-05_boebert.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"The Constitution is clear on federalism. It is
one side, state rights or none. Mr. Schneier?",2025-06-05_boebert.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"Right, so the answer is no. I am short on time.",2025-06-05_boebert.txt
2025-06-05,greene,No? Mr. Schneier?,2025-06-05_boebert.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"No, you cannot. In the state of Georgia, jobs
are extremely important, and AI is, whether we like it or not,
and it is helpful in many ways, and it is not helpful, will
replace jobs. I have a manufacturing district, and the
manufacturing companies are important, but so are the people's
jobs. And if our state cannot regulate or make laws to protect
people's jobs, people are going to go hungry. They are not
going to have paychecks. They are not going to put roofs over
their families' heads. And I think this is such a serious
issue, that we need to look at this through--I will state it
very clearly, I am pro humanity. I am not pro transhumanity.
And when it comes to AI and regulation, when we get to vote on
this bill again, I will be voting no because of this clause,
and we will be working on this further. Thank you so much for
being here today. I now yield to Ms. Simon.",2025-06-05_boebert.txt

2025-06-05,luna,"Thank you, Madam Chair. You know, I want to
thank you all for being here today. One of the biggest concerns
I have with this whole discussion on AI is a failure to admit,
first and foremost, that it does appear that in the next 10
years, that the way that we have grown up and know life with AI
will be forever changing. With that being said, there are a few
differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think
that that is a very serious topic that needs to be discussed
right now.
But specifically, to transhumanism and coupling of AI with
humanity, what regulatory frameworks can be established to
ensure AI-driven transhumanist technologies, like brain-
computer interfaces prioritize human safety and consent? I am
opening this up to everyone on the panel. I have a few
questions, so I would like to get through this, so just please
limit your responses. Mr. B, if you want to go first, or down
there, either/or.",2025-06-05_boebert.txt
2025-06-05,luna,"Is there the possibility of regulation, though,
that exists that would enable transhumanist enhancements that
exacerbate social inequalities or basically financial
inequalities, creating an elite class of enhanced individuals?
I bring that up because we are talking about low-level jobs
potentially being removed from the workforce, people that have
and can afford the ability of, for example, implementing or
implanting chips, given access to unknown amounts of, you know,
knowledge, and essentially creating the first superhuman, and
this is a real concern. I know it might come across as funny to
other people, but I am genuinely concerned about this.
You know, from a bipartisan perspective here, we are
talking about humanity versus machine. Hopefully, in a flowery
world, we would have it set up to where it could, you know,
improve society for the best, but I am also in politics, and I
have a very, unfortunately, sometimes negative perspective on
the world because I have seen the worst of humanity in this

2025-06-05,gosar,"Thanks, Chairwoman. Ms. Miller, you described
the COVID process as a catastrophic event with a high risk of
fraud. I agree. I am the only non-U.S. resident in the United
States to have ever killed a national emergency. I killed
COVID, but there is not a single receipt, though, and since
Bill Clinton through Joe Biden, we have spent over $13
trillion--let me say that again--$13 trillion without a
receipt. Could we use AI to examine the funds spent under
COVID?",2025-06-05_greene.txt

that entities or individuals were actually sued by the
government to get it back, resulting in compensation of over
$300 million. We could use that as well, if it disappeared?

One of my concerns, coming from a technology background,
like, I learned COBOL back in 1999, and a lot of our systems
today, they are on legacy systems. We waste a lot of money on
that, and then with the advent of AI and how fast technology is
moving, you know, the Federal Government has real challenges
with moving forward in a quick way and competing against our
adversaries. So, this is my first question to all the panelists
this afternoon, is if you could just do one thing that could
advance the Federal Government in any way, any agency, any
capability, if you could just do one thing today to help us
utilize AI and technology to move the ball forward, what is
that? What is the one thing you would do? Does not have to be
something big. It could be a small part that makes a big
difference. But what is that one thing you would do right now,
if we could do it tomorrow, snap our fingers? What is it?",2025-06-05_greene.txt
2025-06-05,mace,"Thank you so much, and I yield back. I will now
yield to Ms. Lee for 5 minutes.",2025-06-05_greene.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"[Presiding.] The gentlelady yields. I now
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I
will start with you. Do you support federalism? Yes or no?",2025-06-05_greene.txt

the COVID process as a catastrophic event with a high risk of
fraud. I agree. I am the only non-U.S. resident in the United
States to have ever killed a national emergency. I killed
COVID, but there is not a single receipt, though, and since
Bill Clinton through Joe Biden, we have spent over $13
trillion--let me say that again--$13 trillion without a
receipt. Could we use AI to examine the funds spent under
COVID?",2025-06-05_luna.txt

2025-06-05,mace,"Thank you, and I will now recognize myself for 5
minutes. I want to thank our participants and panelists and
witnesses today for being here.
One of my concerns, coming from a technology background,
like, I learned COBOL back in 1999, and a lot of our systems
today, they are on legacy systems. We waste a lot of money on
that, and then with the advent of AI and how fast technology is
moving, you know, the Federal Government has real challenges
with moving forward in a quick way and competing against our
adversaries. So, this is my first question to all the panelists
this afternoon, is if you could just do one thing that could
advance the Federal Government in any way, any agency, any
capability, if you could just do one thing today to help us
utilize AI and technology to move the ball forward, what is
that? What is the one thing you would do? Does not have to be
something big. It could be a small part that makes a big
difference. But what is that one thing you would do right now,
if we could do it tomorrow, snap our fingers? What is it?",2025-06-05_luna.txt
2025-06-05,mace,"Thank you so much, and I yield back. I will now
yield to Ms. Lee for 5 minutes.",2025-06-05_luna.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"[Presiding.] The gentlelady yields. I now
recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I
will start with you. Do you support federalism? Yes or no?",2025-06-05_luna.txt

one side, state rights or none. Mr. Schneier?",2025-06-05_luna.txt

2025-06-05,greene,No? Mr. Schneier?,2025-06-05_luna.txt
2025-06-05,greene,"No, you cannot. In the state of Georgia, jobs
are extremely important, and AI is, whether we like it or not,
and it is helpful in many ways, and it is not helpful, will
replace jobs. I have a manufacturing district, and the
manufacturing companies are important, but so are the people's
jobs. And if our state cannot regulate or make laws to protect
people's jobs, people are going to go hungry. They are not
going to have paychecks. They are not going to put roofs over
their families' heads. And I think this is such a serious
issue, that we need to look at this through--I will state it
very clearly, I am pro humanity. I am not pro transhumanity.
And when it comes to AI and regulation, when we get to vote on
this bill again, I will be voting no because of this clause,
and we will be working on this further. Thank you so much for
being here today. I now yield to Ms. Simon.",2025-06-05_luna.txt

2025-06-05,luna,"Thank you, Madam Chair. You know, I want to
thank you all for being here today. One of the biggest concerns
I have with this whole discussion on AI is a failure to admit,
first and foremost, that it does appear that in the next 10
years, that the way that we have grown up and know life with AI
will be forever changing. With that being said, there are a few
differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think
that that is a very serious topic that needs to be discussed
right now.
But specifically, to transhumanism and coupling of AI with
humanity, what regulatory frameworks can be established to
ensure AI-driven transhumanist technologies, like brain-
computer interfaces prioritize human safety and consent? I am
opening this up to everyone on the panel. I have a few
questions, so I would like to get through this, so just please
limit your responses. Mr. B, if you want to go first, or down
there, either/or.",2025-06-05_luna.txt
2025-06-05,luna,"Is there the possibility of regulation, though,
that exists that would enable transhumanist enhancements that
exacerbate social inequalities or basically financial
inequalities, creating an elite class of enhanced individuals?
I bring that up because we are talking about low-level jobs
potentially being removed from the workforce, people that have
and can afford the ability of, for example, implementing or
implanting chips, given access to unknown amounts of, you know,
knowledge, and essentially creating the first superhuman, and
this is a real concern. I know it might come across as funny to
other people, but I am genuinely concerned about this.
You know, from a bipartisan perspective here, we are
talking about humanity versus machine. Hopefully, in a flowery
world, we would have it set up to where it could, you know,
improve society for the best, but I am also in politics, and I
have a very, unfortunately, sometimes negative perspective on
the world because I have seen the worst of humanity in this

witnesses today for being here.
One of my concerns, coming from a technology background,
like, I learned COBOL back in 1999, and a lot of our systems
today, they are on legacy systems. We waste a lot of money on
that, and then with the advent of AI and how fast technology is
moving, you know, the Federal Government has real challenges
with moving forward in a quick way and competing against our
adversaries. So, this is my first question to all the panelists
this afternoon, is if you could just do one thing that could
advance the Federal Government in any way, any agency, any
capability, if you could just do one thing today to help us
utilize AI and technology to move the ball forward, what is
that? What is the one thing you would do? Does not have to be
something big. It could be a small part that makes a big
difference. But what is that one thing you would do right now,
if we could do it tomorrow, snap our fingers? What is it?",2025-06-05_mace.txt

recognize myself for 5 minutes.
We just passed the One Big Beautiful Bill through the House
of Representatives, and now it has gone on to the Senate where
they will be making changes to the bill. If there are any
changes made to the One Big Beautiful Bill, it comes back to
the House for a vote and we get a second bite at the apple.
Now, while this bill was going through committees and being
discussed in the House of Representatives, no one on either
side of the aisle that I know of, Republican or Democrat,
brought up this particular clause on one single page in an over
1,000-page bill, and I want to bring this up because I think AI
is incredibly important. I support AI and many different
faculties. However, I think that at this time, as our
generation is very much responsible, not only here in Congress,
but leaders in tech industry and leaders in states and all
around the world have an incredible responsibility of the
future and development, regulation and laws of AI.
It is such an important responsibility, it literally
affects our children and grandchildren's future. So, I take
this responsibility incredibly sincere, so much so that this
past week I have come out in full transparency and said when I
voted for the One Big Beautiful Bill, I did not know about this
clause. I thought I was voting on taxes, energy, and border
security, and this clause right here says a moratorium. In
general, ``Except as provided in Paragraph 2, no state or
political subdivision thereof may enforce during a 10-year
period, beginning on the date of the enactment of this act, any
law or regulation of that state or a political subdivision
thereof, limiting, restricting. or otherwise regulating
artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence
systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate
commerce.''
That is a comprehensive 10-year moratorium. Actually, what
that is, is it is a pause for 10 years in federalism. This
right here, if passed into law, will tell states they cannot
regulate or make laws regarding AI. That means the Federal
Government is the only governing body that can regulate or make
laws for AI in the United States of America. And I would like
to ask each of you, do you support federalism? Yes or no. I
will start with you. Do you support federalism? Yes or no?",2025-06-05_mace.txt

are extremely important, and AI is, whether we like it or not,
and it is helpful in many ways, and it is not helpful, will
replace jobs. I have a manufacturing district, and the
manufacturing companies are important, but so are the people's
jobs. And if our state cannot regulate or make laws to protect
people's jobs, people are going to go hungry. They are not
going to have paychecks. They are not going to put roofs over
their families' heads. And I think this is such a serious
issue, that we need to look at this through--I will state it
very clearly, I am pro humanity. I am not pro transhumanity.
And when it comes to AI and regulation, when we get to vote on
this bill again, I will be voting no because of this clause,
and we will be working on this further. Thank you so much for
being here today. I now yield to Ms. Simon.",2025-06-05_mace.txt

2025-06-05,luna,"Thank you, Madam Chair. You know, I want to
thank you all for being here today. One of the biggest concerns
I have with this whole discussion on AI is a failure to admit,
first and foremost, that it does appear that in the next 10
years, that the way that we have grown up and know life with AI
will be forever changing. With that being said, there are a few
differences that I think most people acknowledge and that AI
lacks a few things, one being a soul, also empathy. And we are
not gods or God, and so I think that we are playing a dangerous
game, especially moving into a future that is simply unknown
right now, especially if we do not essentially develop the
first AI super weapon. Essentially, that is what this is.
Whoever does will essentially control the world, and I think
that that is a very serious topic that needs to be discussed
right now.
But specifically, to transhumanism and coupling of AI with
humanity, what regulatory frameworks can be established to
ensure AI-driven transhumanist technologies, like brain-
computer interfaces prioritize human safety and consent? I am
opening this up to everyone on the panel. I have a few
questions, so I would like to get through this, so just please
limit your responses. Mr. B, if you want to go first, or down
there, either/or.",2025-06-05_mace.txt
2025-06-05,luna,"Is there the possibility of regulation, though,
that exists that would enable transhumanist enhancements that
exacerbate social inequalities or basically financial
inequalities, creating an elite class of enhanced individuals?
I bring that up because we are talking about low-level jobs
potentially being removed from the workforce, people that have
and can afford the ability of, for example, implementing or
implanting chips, given access to unknown amounts of, you know,
knowledge, and essentially creating the first superhuman, and
this is a real concern. I know it might come across as funny to
other people, but I am genuinely concerned about this.
You know, from a bipartisan perspective here, we are
talking about humanity versus machine. Hopefully, in a flowery
world, we would have it set up to where it could, you know,
improve society for the best, but I am also in politics, and I
have a very, unfortunately, sometimes negative perspective on
the world because I have seen the worst of humanity in this

So, everybody but Mr. Schwartz--but I knew you were

a budget but to resort to CRs repeatedly, that that is a major
problem. It is a major problem, and shame on Congress. In my
entire time here, I have only voted for one CR, and I kind of
have buyer's remorse even over that one.
The other thing is, DoD has consistently had crappy audits.
They have never passed an audit, to be frank. And it is because
you have a sclerotic, bureaucratic system, and they told us,
``We are too big to be audited. We do not know where it is all
going.'' That is a huge, huge problem.
So, we have been focusing on procurement today, but I will
just tell you that the previous administration also implemented
something called Project Labor Agreements on Federal contracts.
And those agreements kill competition, they inflate prices,
they block non-union contractors from fair opportunities.
So, the Trump Administration said we are not going to do
that anymore. Federal claims court says, ``That is right. You
do not have to do that.'' Then the district court judge in D.C.

reinstate that.'' The result is you sideline some of the best
contractors, which we were already talking about in the
procurement system, you sideline many contractors. Many
entrepreneurs may be interested, but they do not want to get
